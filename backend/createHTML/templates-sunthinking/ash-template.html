        When considering our personal data, we might first think of key facts
        about ourselves: our name, age, demographic information, and anything else
        collected by official forms. If we expand this definition, we can include
        the memory crumbs which trail behind us as we go about our daily lives.
        Our texts, emails, photos, videos, voice notes — these artefacts which are
        created both incidentally and on purpose end up telling the story of our
        lives. It’s this expanded definition of personal data that I’m going to
        use in this essay. I’m also only talking about
        <em>personal</em>
        data specifically — I have intentionally excluded commercial uses of, and
        attitudes towards, data, its collection, storage, and use.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the pre-digital world, our personal data took up a lot of space. In
        fact, it took up exactly as much space as the thing that it was. If you
        wrote a letter, it would take up exactly one letter’s worth of space on
        your desk, in your drawer, in a folder, or in your bin. If you wanted to
        create a copy of a document, that copy would again take up the same amount
        of space as the original. There was no abstraction in form between the
        data, what it represented, and the space it took up. Hard copy storage is
        grounded in the material.

        Digital technologies have undermined a 1:1 relationship between stored
        data and the scale and form of its storage medium. As magnetic tape,
        floppy disks, and eventually computer hard drives developed, the amount of
        data we could store in the same office, drawer, cabinet, or suitcase
        expanded exponentially. While storage has not yet been entirely divorced
        from physicality — there is still a relationship between digital file size
        and the amount of storage space it takes in the real world — we can afford
        to be a lot more liberal about what we choose to keep. As storage
        technology has continued to develop, it has become almost impossible for
        most people to perceive the relationship between physical size and storage
        capacity.

        The physicality of storage, by which I mean the space it materially takes
        up and the quality of said space, is directly related to how we might
        curate, organise, sort, and store the data it contains. Consider an
        expansive DVD collection — this data takes a very physical form, but is
        still much more compact than VHS tapes, and even smaller still than reels
        of film. For someone with a particularly large film collection, their DVDs
        might take up a wall of a room in their home. This method of storage means
        that they exist alongside their DVDs — they see them every day. They might
        choose to sort them in a way that’s visually pleasing, or alphabetical, or
        chronological, so that they’re satisfied at how organised their DVDs are
        every time they see them. They might be forced to forgo a purchase of a
        new DVD simply because they don’t have space for any more. They might
        decide to sell some to make room for more DVDs (or something else
        entirely). The DVD collector in this scenario has a habitual and
        incidental relationship with the data they’re storing. They revisit it
        regularly, and can easily understand how the size of their collection
        relates to the amount of data (films) they have stored, as well as the
        capacity they have for storing other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before digital storage, two main factors influenced the data, or
        artefacts, we created, and those that we kept: ease of creation (or
        reproduction) and physical storage space. Moving into early-digital,
        pre-cloud contexts, we were less influenced by how easy it was to make
        something (writing a letter is a lot faster using a word processor than
        writing by hand), but still quite heavily influenced by how much space it
        took to store something (if you fill up a USB stick, you need to either
        delete something, move something to more permanent, archival storage, or
        get another USB stick). In the contemporary context, it is both easy to
        create or reproduce an artefact and storage is no longer something with
        which we have an incidental, habitual, spatial relationship. There are no
        longer ‘natural’ limiting factors on our capacity to create and store
        artefacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        As storage becomes less grounded in its physicality, it’s harder to grasp
        what it means for a file to be ‘large’, or to keep track of just how many
        artefacts we’re holding on to. Part of the attempt to address this
        disconnection is through the use of skeuomorphic design. For something to
        be skeuomorphic, its design must echo elements of that same object when
        made from another material, or used in a different context. In this case,
        we’re referring to digital representations of things which are familiar
        for their non-digital function, like a note pad, or a bin. When desktop
        computers were entering the mainstream, their interfaces utilised a wide
        range of skeuomorphic objects in order to help new users bridge the gap
        between the paper office and the digital office.

      </p>
      <p>
        Skeuomorphic folders are designed to look just like the folders you’d find
        in a filing cabinet. Deleting a file requires you to drag and drop it in
        the trash can sitting at the corner of your desktop. To save something,
        you invoke the power of the floppy disk. In the early days of widespread
        computer use, this proved a powerful tool for assisting the general
        population in adapting to new technologies. However, these skeuomorphs
        rapidly shed their utility. As time passes, new generations are born who
        possess no frame of reference for the physical counterparts of said
        skeuomorphs.

        A 2021 Verge article

          <sup>7</sup>
        </a>
        laid bare an apparent lack in the technical skill of Gen Z university
        students. The article claims that young adults are entering higher
        education with no innate understanding of how digital file systems work.
        It (and a similar article in The Byte from around the same time
        <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref">
          <sup>8</sup>
        </a>
        ) asserts that many Gen Z and younger think of computer storage as an
        infinite, searchable bucket. And why should they think any differently?
        Those who have grown up with efficient, powerful search tools and
        expanding access to cloud storage, may have never had to develop an
        effective method of structuring their own data. They have no inherent
        understanding of the physicality of data, and how managing, curating, and
        organising that data has previously been absolutely necessary to
        accommodate storage limitations.

        One of the biggest shifts in how we store our personal data has been that
        we no longer keep it in our own homes. Cloud storage has been widely
        adopted, meaning we no longer have to face the reality of not physically
        having enough storage capacity of our own — we can always borrow more (for
        a price). The physical limitation of space on our storage habits has been
        replaced with a purely financial subscription model, a virtual asset with
        unlimited flex, rather than a material, spatial expansion. Digital storage
        has become perceived as an infinite resource.

      </h3>
      <p>
        The cloud is removed from our everyday environment, conjuring images of
        our photos, emails, and voice memos floating around in the sky above us.
        It takes a weight off our chests, and casts it to the heavens. The cloud
        is somewhere else, and any problems created by simply having too much
        stuff are now someone else’s problems. When resources are virtual,
        infinite, and expandable via subscription, the consequences of
        overconsuming are indirect and out of sight. We are rarely confronted with
        the environmental reality of our reliance on datacentres.

        Largely, this trajectory was pushed by Google. Following the introduction
        of Gmail in 2004, which provided 500 times more storage than Hotmail
        (weighing in at a hefty 1GB per user at launch), our relationship with
        what’s possible or practical to save changed forever. Initially, Gmail
        didn’t even include a delete button
        <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref">
          <sup>11</sup>
        </a>
        . Not only was it no longer necessary to delete emails regularly to make
        space in your inbox, but it was actually not even
        <em>possible</em>
        . This shift broke everyone’s deletion habit — it ended the ritualistic
        appraisal of what should be kept, and ushered in a default in which
        literally everything should.

        Google was only able to afford to offer such expansive storage to everyone
        who wanted it, for free, because the company scraped and extracted value
        from everything we stored with them. The data they collected from everyday
        communications was used to sell relevant, highly targeted advertising
        space. Google ony stopped using emails in this way in 2017

      <p>
        In a study commissioned by Fujifilm in March 2022
        <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref">
          <sup>13</sup>
        </a>
        , 97% of all adults surveyed said that they use cloud storage for some or
        all of their photos. Only 12% of those surveyed spend money on additional
        storage, and 7 out of 10 admitted to transferring old photos onto new
        devices without filtering or organising them in any way. The survey also
        queried how often participants would go back and review their collections
        — the average rate was only once a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        The study was intended to determine whether younger adults feel more
        precarious about their memories in the context of COVID changing how we
        interact with technology. The study’s conclusion was that they do, because
        they hold on to more photos than other demographics surveyed; with over a
        third of those surveyed citing concern over forgetting memories and events
        as the reason they don’t delete their images. An additional third of those
        surveyed said looking at past memories helps to brighten their day,
        despite the low rate at which those memories are reviewed. This infrequent
        revisiting is the point I find most salient here. If these photos are
        truly a crutch to bolster our memory, and boost our mood, wouldn’t we
        spend a bit more time, well, remembering?
      </p>

      <p>
        Entrusting our memories to the cloud, and with such large collections of
        personal data being quite commonplace, many people rely heavily on cloud
        storage providers to keep their memories safe. In an informal survey of
        friends, colleagues, and followers on federated networks (86 respondents),
        around half reported having photo collections on their phones of more than
        5,000 images, with just over 70% reporting more than 1,000 images stored.
        Collection habits have vastly outgrown typical local storage capacities,
        so often it’s not possible to have total control of data storage without
        significant investment in local, offline capacity. With this level of
        trust in cloud storage, it’s easy to think it’s unlikely for anything to
        go wrong, and that it will always be there. Unfortunately, that’s simply
        not the case.

        In 2019, news broke that MySpace had lost 12 years of music during a
        server migration
        <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref">
          <sup>14</sup>
        </a>
        . Many of these songs were never uploaded anywhere else — MySpace had been
        the permanent record of these artists’ musical output. It’s estimated that
        up to 50 million tracks were lost in this incident alone. To put into
        perspective just how much data is stored by social media companies like
        MySpace, Meta (formerly known as Facebook) has continually expanded its
        first data centre, built in 2011, to a size of more than 3 million square
        feet as of 2018
        <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref">
          <sup>15</sup>
        </a>
        . According to their own maps
        <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref">
          <sup>16</sup>
        </a>
        , they have 21 data centres currently in operation, across North America,
        Europe, and Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        MySpace’s servers, just like any other computer, are and were subject to
        the same entropy as anything which has a material form. Just because cloud
        storage isn’t something we can immediately see and touch doesn’t mean it
        lacks a physical presence somewhere on the planet. Cloud storage is still
        subject to fire, flood, earthquake, or simply decay over time — all of
        which can be mitigated to an extent but not entirely prevented
        <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref">
          <sup>17</sup>
        </a>
        . Anything stored in the cloud could be lost, just as a letter given to
        you as a kid could fall down the side of your desk, or get burnt in a
        fire, or have a cup of water spilled onto it, or simply fade until the ink
        is no longer legible at all.

        I consider our collections of personal data to be a kind of informal
        archive
        <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref">

          <sup>19</sup>
        </a>
        . By informal, I mean that in contrast to a traditional archive
        collection, it’s not professionally looked after, sorted, or
        contextualised. Formal archives have someone whose job it is to know them.
        There is an archivist, or a team of archivists, who are aware of all of
        the parts and how they fit together. Informal archives (of the kind we’re
        contributing to every time we send a text, email, or take a photo) are
        unsorted and largely left untouched. The information isn’t studied, or
        stored in a way which is easy to access effectively. Our personal
        collections are buckets of information which have no logical
        relationships, no archivist, and no contextual anchors by which to
        understand them.

        Archives hold key information which paints a picture of the humans of the

        . When we create an archive of ourselves, we’re contributing to a kind of
        historicisation of our very near past. It freezes in amber a version of
        ourselves we’ve not yet had time to grow away from. Formal archives are
        subject to regulation and data protection laws, removing them temporally
        from the person or people who are documented within them. Our informal,
        personal collections are not subject to this same kind of removal — they
        can be used to inform decisions about relationships with ourselves and
        others almost in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most common ways to access information in our personal
        collections is through algorithmic ‘on this day’ features, now built in to
        most smartphones and mainstream social media platforms. This kind of tool
        was developed because we love to think about ourselves. We love to
        reminisce on good memories and (most importantly for the social platforms
        which developed this style of technology) we’re likely to reshare
        particularly positive or impactful moments with our friends.
        Unfortunately, due to the totally removed aspect of human curation when it
        comes to working with our personal collections, it’s just as likely that
        formative bad memories will be dug up and presented to us as good ones.
        This is an example of algorithmic cruelty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both our formal and informal archives have a complex relationship with
        being publicly accessible. Formal archives are made public often through
        institutions, which may restrict access to certain parts in order to
        protect the subjects of those archives. It’s common practice for archives
        to be sealed for 100 years when they refer to identifiable individuals in
        order to avoid impacting the everyday lives of those documented in the
        collections. Our informal archives, however, are often self-published. We
        become our own curators, choosing a highlight reel to present to the wider
        online public on our profile pages. We present an idealised, aestheticised
        version of ourselves, and then puppet that self as part of our social
        interactions in the online landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharing our informal collections through our own curated lens changes our
        image of self. We start to blur the edges between our whole, offline,
        flawed self, and our curated, online, idealised self. We’re playing a
        roleplaying game we never realised we signed up for, and it’s one that can
        bleed outwards into our offline lives too. We start to treat our curated,
        projected collection as if it is reflective of the whole, and see others
        in the same light.
      </p>
      <p>
        It used to be commonplace to have a ‘screenname’ or ‘username’. Online, we
        would consensually enter the role of someone else, our online character,
        who would be distinct from our offline self. Our screen persona could
        embody characteristics about ourselves that we mediated offline, or be a
        channel for exploring things our offline selves would never do. It was
        protected in its distinction. With the dawn of Facebook, we started to see
        an increase in usage of our offline names (or ‘real names’) in online
        spaces. Mark Zuckerberg explicitly pursues a ‘real name policy’ on
        Facebook, and it’s common for those who change their name, or go by a
        different name, to have their account deactivated if Facebook detects any
        incongruence.

        This usage of ‘real names’ in online spaces helped collapse the
        distinction between our online and offline selves. We started logging on
        to roleplay as a version of our self, not as a character with a totally
        different identity. Suddenly, the things we did online started bleeding
        out into our real life social sphere. Not only did Zuckerberg have a
        vision of an internet where everyone extends their offline self in a
        networked plane, but he asked people to bring their offline social
        connections into the online space. He was aiming to replicate communities
        which formed through lived experience, through proximity, or connections
        which were probably only supposed to be fleeting, in an online space.
        Online spaces, especially those which consider themselves ‘platforms’,
        introduce a collapse of distance, context, and a binary vision of whether
        someone is your ‘friend’. The process of replicating these offline
        connections expedited the ‘leak’ of our offline lives into our online
        lives, and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, most Gen Z don’t remember a time before Facebook. For people with
        this experience, lines between ‘offline self’ and ‘online self’ have
        always been blurred, each informing the other. Online is no longer a
        separate space in which to escape or explore fantasy, but an extension of
        the physical neighbourhood, educational institution, or workplace you
        frequent every day. It could be argued that ‘real name’ policies only
        impact the sites on which they are enforced, but like anything with mass
        adoption, the habits of users have shifted to reflect its impact on how we
        view our online profiles. There is now an expectation in many online
        spaces that users will present a version of their ‘real’ or offline
        selves, rather than a pseudonymous alter.

        Taking a screenshot is a way of legitimising something
      </h3>
      <p>
        It’s a flag in the sand that says ‘I want to save this, and look at it
        later. This is important enough.’ For something to be screenshot-worthy,
        it’s crossed the threshold that you not only want to keep it, but you want
        to know where it is. It reached something within you that makes the
        ongoing automated collection of our movements as we traverse the internet
        no longer sufficient for this kind of recollection, and you want to be
        able to step back inside this moment — either because it’s important to
        other people or because it’s important to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Platforms like Snapchat enact a short-form expiry policy for messages
        shared through their service. This brings a sense of immediate loss,
        heightening the feeling that whatever you’re looking at is slipping
        through your fingers. This sense of immediate loss encourages
        screenshot-based activation — we want to hold onto as much as we can when
        we’re talking to someone we care about, or experiencing heightened
        emotions together. They encourage the natural curation-of-memory behaviour
        that’s absent in so much of how we interact online — this is happening
        <em>now</em>
        , and then it’s gone forever.

        It can be uncomfortable to find that something you shared, which you
        thought would be fleeting, has been saved by someone else without your
        knowledge or consent, especially when engaging with text-based chat. Chat
        conversations move quickly and can be more unfiltered and candid than
        something you’d publish purposefully. In pursuing a direct analogue to
        real-life fleeting conversation, Snapchat encourages the kind of
        spontaneous emotional traversal common to one-on-one, private
        conversations offline. Their service cultivates a sense of safety in the
        transience of the information transmitted between users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sense of intimacy that fleeting conversation cultivates means that it
        can feel like a betrayal to find out that something you shared in
        confidence has been screenshotted and rebroadcast more widely, out of the
        context of the original conversation. To try and combat this sense of
        betrayal, Snapchat implemented notifications that informed the other
        person that you had screenshotted something. Yet as soon as this had been
        implemented, we came up with ways to circumvent these notifications.

        In addition to what we capture in order to rebroadcast, screenshots take
        on another quality when they contribute to our collected archive of
        personal data. They contribute to our sense of self.

        The things we choose to keep hold of shape us. They remind us what we’ve
        been through, where we’ve travelled, who we’ve met and what we’ve done, in
        ways that when unaided, we tend to forget.

        A pebble from an important beach holds so much more within it than just
        the stone itself. When so many of our memories take place digitally, it’s
        no wonder that we’ve devised a method to take home souvenirs from our
        digital escapades.
      </p>
      <h3 id="we-only-have-so-much-capacity-to-remember">
        We only have so much capacity to remember
      </h3>
      <p>
        Many of the tools we’ve built over time are explicitly to aid in
        supporting our memories. In theory, what we choose to preserve is kept
        safe, a kind of highlight reel — and maybe this was true when we had
        limited resources to create, store, and recover precious memories. In a
        time when taking these snapshots takes very little energy, time, or
        judgement, our ability to discover, recall, and properly sort our
        collected memories is impaired.
      </p>
      <p>
        When these memories are published, we contribute to a shared memory bank —
        a narrative of the world created by, for, and within, a kind of collective
        consciousness. Like the formal archive, we turn to this collective
        externalised memory to form our narrative about what it’s like to live in
        the world, what it’s been like in the past, and the decisions we make
        moving forwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        When our self image, and the images we form of others, are externalised,
        they’re subject to the whims of that external environment. When that
        external environment is controlled, owned, or stewarded by a private
        company, we can no longer trust that our own externalised self isn’t being
        used simply to manipulate us into furthering the commercial goals of said
        company. Thinking back to the emergence of ‘on this day’ tools — these use
        our self-image in order to generate clicks and retain eyeballs on
        commercial platforms. It’s our self being chewed up and fed back to us in
        order to sell advertising space.

        What would the world be like if all personal data had some kind of built
        in expiry date? We’ve already touched on the impact that Snapchat’s expiry
        feature has on how we feel about conversations made using its platform.
        Elsewhere, expiration is implemented through optional disappearing
        messages (an increasingly common feature across many chat platforms),
        iMessage audio files disappearing after two minutes unless you choose to
        keep them forever, and Instagram stories which vanish after 24 hours.
        Interestingly, in the case of Instagram stories, their transience is
        performed — the uploader can still access stories after their expiry in
        their ‘stories archive’. While Instagram stories appear
        <em>outwardly</em>
        to subscribe to the ethos of data expiry, in reality it just creates
        another mass, unsorted archive (by any metric other than chronologically).

        Giving data a limited lifespan by default is an approach which is usually
        only applied to communications that are designed to feel more transient,
        such as digital analogues to spoken chatter, or services which encourage a
        momentary capture of your ‘now’. Digital artefacts like emails, photos,
        and videos (which aren’t captured to share immediately) are seemingly
        never included in the conversation about expiration, perhaps because they
        are products of analogue processes which were designed specifically for
        the purpose of recording our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could we go about applying an expiry protocol to these artefacts?
        First, I think their erasure must be complete. Nobody, anywhere should
        have a copy of what was written or captured once it has expired. I think
        this completeness is absolutely essential in order for the erasure to have
        a real impact on how we feel about the things we choose to keep. I also
        think the period between creation and deletion needs to be long enough
        that you’re done with short-term processing before the data slips away.
        You should have had enough time to create it, think about it a little bit,
        come back to it, and evaluate whether or not it should be saved, but not
        enough time that you’re a fundamentally different person by the time you
        stumble back across it

      <p>
        In a world with expiration by default in place, what would change? On a
        practical level, we would get more mileage out of less computing power.
        We’d be going from a disposable and greedy type of usage, a hoarding
        behaviour, to one which would recognise that if the box is full, you need
        to take something out of the box, instead of building infinite extensions
        until there’s nothing left to build with.
        <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref">

        We would have a better understanding of what informs us as people because
        the external framework that we rely on to assist our memory would be by
        nature more goopy and imperfect and rounded. We would have reintroduced a
        more natural entropy into a digital context, and be empowered to move on
        from damaging patterns of behaviour — like diving into a sprawling,
        decades-old message log just to prove a point or to make a pain feel
        fresh.

          <sup>32</sup>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        We’d also have a more intuitive understanding of the relationship between
        our actual, lived, day-to-day experience and the collected data we both
        choose to keep, and that which we choose to publicly present in order to
        represent or illustrate our whole selves. Instead of a mass, unexamined,
        uncurated bulk of information about us languishing on the public internet
        for others to take at face value, we would have small collections of
        trinket, tokens and souvenirs that would imply a larger story than the
        item itself. If everyone was in the same boat, having our stories informed
        by the souvenirs we choose to save (rather than letting algorithms choose
        for us from a sea of everything we’ve ever seen, thought, or done) would
        encourage us to afford that same grace to others — the grace of
        acknowledging that there’s more behind the public presentation of curated
        trinkets, and that a flat profile should never be confused for the
        complex, expansive, whole.
