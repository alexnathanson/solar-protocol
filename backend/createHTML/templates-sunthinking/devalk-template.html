        <p>This tiny dictionary was born on rosa, a small yet significant
        feminist server that traveled to six communities in different
        European cities in 2022, as part of the project <a
        href="#a-traversal-network-of-feminist-servers">A Traversal Network
        of Feminist Servers (ATNOFS)</a>. rosa’s Ecofeminist Dictionary
        (rED) is the result of many conversations I had with those who have
        logged in and out of rosa in the past year.</p>
        <p>While working on a PhD research project looking into how
        communities of practice try to diminish the environmental impact of
        their network infrastructures, I started collecting terms:
        permacomputing, collapse informatics, salvage computing, convivial
        technology, low tech, and more.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> What struck me was
        that coining terms seemed to be the domain of white men, which meant
        that conversations about this topic happened in the terms of a
        rather homogeneous demographic. However beautiful the wording, the
        lack of diversity was painful. When Wendy van Wynsberghe tagged me
        in a message on Mastodon about a call for proposals, I decided to
        join what turned out to be ATNOFS to find out what the practices
        around feminist servers have to say about a smaller environmental
        footprint and to find out if there is such a thing as an <a
        href="#ecofeminist-servers">ecofeminist server</a>.</p>
        <p>I traversed each chapter – <a href="#hypha">hypha</a> (RO), <a
        href="#feminist-hack-meetings">Feminist Hack Meetings</a> (GR), <a
        href="#esc-medien-kunst-labor">esc medien kunst labor</a> (AT), <a
        href="#varia">Varia</a> (NL), <a href="#constant">Constant</a> (BE)
        and <a href="#lurk">LURK</a> (NL/UK) - with this focus, picking up
        on different threads throughout the project. Towards the end, I
        asked each community to suggest a term that could reflect their
        practice. Not as an act of territoriality, of coining a word, but as
        an attempt to deterritorialize the language around sustainability
        and ICT, to speak about it in our own words. This attention to
        language and wordings was a common thread throughout the project, a
        (re)claiming of space by (re)naming, speaking in and on our own
        terms with each other when logged on rosa. This text is a
        republishing of the original dictionary <a href="#fn2"

        <p>Thank you to all who took the time to hang out and talk. It was
        so enjoyable, I forgot I was working. While writing I realized that
        representing these conversations perfectly is impossible, so I tried
        to find my balance on the thin line between ‘you had to be there’
        and quoting people word for word, but I cannot resist this one, from
        a recorded conversation between me, Alice Strete, and Cristina
        Cochior:</p>
        <blockquote>
        “M: maybe it’s time we return… we’ve been away for 25 minutes. I had
        lots of stuff to discuss but we sort of meandered. That’s OK, I
        didn’t want to be very structured with questions like ‘what is a
        feminist server?’ and then note down your answer and copy it into my
        thesis.<br />
        A: we also don’t have an answer :)”
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="ecofeminist-and-always-unfinished-space-making">Ecofeminist
        and Always Unfinished Space Making</h2>
        <p><em>Based on two conversations with Sergiu Nisioi and Anca Bucur
        of <a href="#hypha">hypha</a>.</em></p>
        <p>The first thing that surfaced during my discussions with hypha is
        a confrontation with the paradox of sustainable and feminist ICT.
        hypha acknowledges that network technologies are deeply patriarchal
        and have a patriarchal history that continues to spread unequally in
        the world. True autonomy and environmental sustainability are
        impossible in this context, you are always enmeshed in patriarchal,
        capitalist, and unsustainable systems, so the only thing you can do
        is to make do with what you have, with what is already there. This
        acknowledgement doesn’t mean surrendering, but functions as a
        catalyst for doing technology otherwise, for <a
        href="#possible-ongoingness">possible ongoingness</a>.</p>
        <p>For hypha the practices developed around rosa made it clear that
        rosa is a feminist server not because of any specific technology or
        tool, but because of how we engaged with each other, how rosa gave
        us a common space. This common space was rooted in feminist ways of
        thinking and theorizing about the world. This involves the idea of
        care — to have something together that we — the people around rosa —
        can take care of, and in doing this, we create occasions to
        reinforce our community, to know each other better, to know about
        the space and how to use it. Examples of this care include paying
        attention to issues around consent and understanding what we are
        each comfortable giving and receiving. It’s like a house: what’s
        important is how we’re collectively deciding to live in it, not the
        house itself. Because of this, hypha didn’t want to focus their
        chapter on providing technical knowledge to others to self host, but
        on hanging out together, learning to share this space, and figuring
        out how we want to use it. It’s a space to collectively take care
        of; we’re not focusing on the tech but on the community it gives
        space to.</p>
        <p>This space-making is always unfinished and ongoing. In hypha’s
        context there is no funding, which means that such an endeavor can
        only be carried forward by a collective of volunteers with little
        time on their hands. It’s a financial problem. Ongoingness relies on
        a very delicate balance of giving and taking. The risk of tasks
        becoming too heavy a burden is high, and with this the risk of
        irritations and conflict. Setting up any kind of technological
        infrastructure cannot fall on the shoulders of one person and
        requires a gradual process of consolidation in a heterogeneous group
        bringing together different backgrounds and types of knowledge; it’s
        an ongoing process of learning from each other. It can only converge
        in a local and specific way. hypha doesn’t intend to copy practices
        from elsewhere and cannot afford to either.</p>
        <blockquote>
        “While urging for depriving the technological apparatus of its
        classist and gendered strains and vocabularies, hypha stands for a
        knowledge situated collective emancipation. It intends to carry
        workshops and lectures, taking on new-materialist, eco-feminist,
        hacktivist possibilities of software actualizations and
        embodiments.” — hypha, 2022.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Which brings me to ecofeminism, which has always linked feminism
        with environmentalism and decoloniality, without prioritizing one
        over the others but showing how they are interrelated<a href="#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. hypha’s space-making is
        informed by ecofeminist and decolonial thought. That means not
        copying technology and practices or borrowing language from the
        west, which are meant to scale to a global level and are based on
        digital extractivism. Instead, they see their practice as a
        reconfiguring of scale, thinking through digital spaces in a
        situated and local way, important in disseminating and sharing
        knowledge. They are in the process of learning about setting up and
        maintaining online shared spaces with queer and marginalized groups,
        with a decolonial way of doing.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, hypha mused, the only way to go about things locally is
        to stay on a local area network (LAN) and only much later connect
        multiple local networks together, but first just to make a local
        server and connect to it.</p>
        <h2 id="η-διακομιστής-idiakomistis">Η Διακομιστής
        (Idiakomistis)</h2>
        <p><em>Based on two conversations with Mara Karagianni, Artemis
        Gryllaki and Aggeliki Diakrousi of <a
        href="#feminist-hack-meetings">Feminist Hack Meetings</a>.</em></p>
        <p>When I asked Feminist Hack Meetings (FHM) about their
        infrastructure and their ways of thinking through its ecological
        impact I was confronted with some assumptions I had to get rid off.
        FHM doesn’t have an infrastructure, and even if it did, it doesn’t
        have a space to put that infrastructure in. Even if it had a space,
        they haven’t had time to think about the environmental impact of
        their work because they have been struggling to find time to focus
        on something that is more urgent in their context: <a
        href="#ecofeminist-and-always-unfinished-space-making">making
        space</a> in Athens for feminist ways of understanding tech
        literacy. Local feminist groups are mostly focused on community
        building in which technology doesn’t play an important role. Local
        hackerspaces haven’t been very open to feminist practices. FHM
        received hostile reactions to the language they used; for instance
        calling a server ‘feminist’ and their translation of the word
        ‘server’ into Greek, η διακομιστής, with one part of the word
        gendered female and the other male. This is unorthodox but
        meaningful to FHM because in Greek the female version of a word
        sounds smaller or less significant than the male, less valued or
        valuable. They wanted to challenge the associations of gendered
        language and of gender and technology. Someone from a local
        hackerspace accused them of violating the language. There were many
        more similar anecdotes. They did not expect such hostile responses
        to their work.</p>
        <p>FHM puts a lot of care into translation. They want to break with
        the idea that ICT is only for experts, that it is hard. For
        non-native English speakers the jargon involved in server
        administration can be an obstacle to learning new skills, therefore,
        during the FHM chapter in Athens, all presentations were in Greek,
        which were live translated into English. The workshops were in
        English but with a live Greek translation. This greatly improved
        accessibility and because the live translations slowed down the pace
        of things with regular pauses, the audience had more time to process
        what was being said. It gave people time to reflect. This was a very
        positive experience. There was a lack of infrastructure though.
        Because the space didn’t have a proper mixer, the streaming was very
        complex, seamful like <a href="#patchwork-computing">patchwork
        computing</a> but taking a toll on human time and energy. There was
        no WiFi either at that moment, meaning they had to use three phone
        hotspots for their network connections. This became such a complex
        situation that at one point they accidentally streamed both
        languages simultaneously, but only very briefly. Someone listening
        said it was kind of beautiful.</p>
        <h3 id="networks-of-care-and-trust">Networks of Care and Trust</h3>
        <p>There is so much work to do; ecological considerations are not
        the top priority. How can you rethink your network infrastructure in
        environmental ways if you don’t have any infrastructure to begin
        with? The work is done under difficult circumstances and this is a
        heavy burden to carry for all those involved. Yet FHM cultivates a
        very valuable and inspiring way of working <a
        href="#with-in-limits">With / in Limits</a>. They are a very
        lightweight organization, being nomadic and sharing resources with
        other organizations for lack of their own infrastructure. It has
        resulted in FHM being embedded in a <a
        href="#networks-of-care-and-trust">network of care and trust</a>
        with a long history in feminist tech skill-sharing. They are
        connected to systerserver, which “offers services to its network of
        feminist, queer and antipatriarchal folks.”<a href="#fn5"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
        Systerserver was launched early 2005 by Genderchangers, “a group of
        women and women-identified gender minorities, started at the ASCII
        hacklab around 1999”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, who:</p>

        <p>Genderchangers started the Eclectic Tech Carnival (/ETC) in 2002,

        everyday skills and information technologies in the context of free
        software and open hardware.”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> /ETC was hosted in
        Athens in 2019, which is when the idea for FHM took shape. Through
        systerserver they are connected to mur.at<a href="#fn9"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, a grassroots ‘art server farm’

        connected to <a href="#constant">Constant</a> through, for instance,
        the sharing of their Big Blue Button video conferencing platform.
        This network is thoroughly connected to many people participating in
        ATNOFS and beyond. So FHM asks: why would we need a server anyway?
        This <a href="#networks-of-care-and-trust">network of care and

        <h2 id="jenga-computing">Jenga Computing</h2>
        <p><em>Based on two conversations with Roel Roscam Abbing, Lídia
        Pereira, and Aymeric Mansoux of <a href="#lurk">LURK</a>.</em></p>
        <p>LURK mostly works on their servers and services with very little
        time and, up until very recently, no budget so, “everything is
        working on scraps, DIY and tons of tons of gaffer tape.” One of the
        servers that was running the mailing list used to be just hack on
        top of hack to keep it running. It only started to look properly
        administered quite recently. I don’t think anyone in the LURK
        community notices, but from the administrator point of view, it
        feels like one of those super fragile games where it’s all in a very
        fine balance… touch one wrong piece and it all collapses: <a
        href="#jenga-computing">Jenga Computing</a>. The word jenga is
        derived from the Swahili word – kujenga – ‘to build’, but for LURK,
        Jenga refers to a fragile balance. It relates to the diagram they
        made for their chapter’s workshop. It was called <em>precipice
        workflow</em>. There is a logic behind what they do, but they are
        constantly trying to make room for something that takes time and is
        complicated, yet often situations force them to act quickly.</p>
        <p>Building things from scraps and (making do)[#making-do] with what
        they can find made them think of a 2020 Mastodon toot by Diana
        Thayer about a future with two major camps of techno-radicals:
        librists and junkers. The description of the junkers especially
        resonated with LURK.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“librists – actually, libre-ists – believe in ethical works from
        the ground up. they operate far-flung rare earth repositories and
        small-scale manufacturies which produce artisanal computers. wood
        finish, decent transistor count, moddable, open source. in many
        ways: the dream of open hardware.</p>
        <p>Junkers take what exists. the logistics of producing electronics
        are slow at best and critically unreliable the rest of the time, so
        junkers repair machines left by the capitalists, it’s shit tech made
        shittier by age, but there’s plenty of it so at least you never run
        out of spares.</p>
        <p>‘That’s comcast tech,’ a librist says with disgust.</p>
        ‘Zero net waste op,’ the junker replies dismissively.” — Diana

        <h3 id="making-do">Making Do</h3>
        <p>LURK’s Mastodon instance requires a more powerful machine, for
        which LURK is supported by Greenhost, but for their back-up server
        and Agnes, which is running xmpp, the mailinglist and mumble, they
        reuse old hardware. Even though this initially wasn’t driven by an
        ecological motive, it results in a smaller footprint. The production
        of hardware is responsible for most of the resource use and energy
        consumption in a device’s lifecycle, meaning that most energy is
        already consumed before a device is turned on for the first time. <a
        href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Being frugal with energy is of
        course a good idea, but it can never compensate for the energy used
        during a device’s production: buying a more efficient machine is not
        a solution (unless it concerns a device that uses more energy during
        its use-phase than during its production, such as a kettle). Next to
        that, working with older hardware means working <a
        href="#with-in-limits">With / in Limits</a>. Especially on Agnes,
        everything needs to be lean because it doesn’t have a lot of power.
        They don’t use virtualisation, for instance, because it uses too
        many resources. Not optimizing is not acceptable. They’ve always
        considered that as simple ethics — not doing it would be
        wasteful.</p>
        <p>LURK traces the ethics of anti-wastefulness back to practices
        from 25 years ago. At that time hacker communities repurposed old
        machines and discarded hardware by putting Linux on it. A lot of
        places, like Access Space in Sheffield and Amsterdam Subversive
        Center for Information Interchange (ASCII),<a href="#fn12"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> were using this approach. At
        that time it was more anti-consumerism than environmental activism:
        giving a second life to these things and giving them to people who
        couldn’t afford a new machine. Things have changed a lot since then
        though: old machines are still fine for low level tasks, but
        crapware such as bloated websites, video conferencing tools, and
        office suites ruin this potential for the average user. For servers
        it can still work, depending on what types of services you are
        running. Our conversation paused briefly, then LURK’s junker ethos
        was expressed thus:</p>
        <blockquote>
        “We are not forecasting about collapse, we are not environmentally
        friendly by design, we are mirroring the shit we are in. We’re
        trying to make do with bits and pieces.” — Lurk, 2022

        they approach the Code of Conduct (CoC) and Terms of Service (ToS)<a

        role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> of their Mastodon instance as
        living documents that need to be performed is clearly rooted in
        feminist practice. These texts are constantly updated based on what
        the moderators experience. LURK is attentive to how these documents
        work in two directions, relying on users flagging problems to
        moderators, as well as relying on the wordings of their CoC and ToS
        making users feel either encouraged or discouraged to report certain
        things to the moderators, especially things that are hard to
        describe in a set of rules; micro-aggressions such as being made to
        feel invisible, regularly being corrected on details, or subtle
        sub-toots only recognizable as such by the one targeted. LURK wants
        to pay attention to this intangible unease you can experience in
        online social spaces, so people feel more legitimized to mention it
        to the moderators.</p>
        <p>LURK started experimenting with a model for financial
        sustainability of their services through voluntary donations by
        users via Open Collective<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, a legal and
        financial toolbox for grassroots groups. They try to test and create
        a precedent that can hopefully help normalize paying for services
        that commercial actors are able to offer for free because of their
        business models based on user surveillance, targeted advertisement,
        and data brokering. LURK’s funds support labor instead of hardware
        and are visibilizing normally invisible labor to help improve things
        “one jenga block at a time”. LURK succeeded in receiving trust from
        a group of people who feel at home on their servers. They don’t
        consider themselves a shelter but do believe there is something
        happening, something consistent, people tend to stick around.</p>
        <h2 id="patchwork-computing">Patchwork computing</h2>
        <p><em>This description is based on two discussions I had with
        Cristina Cochior, Alice Strete, Manetta Berends, Amy Pickles, and
        Julia Bande of <a href="#varia">Varia</a>.</em></p>
        <p>Varia prepared rosa before the start of the project, during a
        series of Thursday evening get-togethers. During these meetings a
        lot of thought was given to what functionality would be needed, a
        careful selection of tools to accommodate ways of working together.
        It was clear that this wouldn’t be a simple install party. rosa
        would not start from scratch, nothing ever does, but instead would
        be built using a patchwork of projects, scripts, and tools
        originating from <a href="#varia">Varia</a>, XPUB<a href="#fn15"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>, <a
        href="#constant">Constant</a> and the wider networks they are part
        of. This method made a point of showing the seams by not automating
        everything. This mattered because it made everyone more aware of all
        the moving parts. This seamful patching together of small tools,
        adapting them to a specific context to allow for meaningful
        engagement, is <a href="#patchwork-computing">patchwork
        computing</a>.</p>
        <p>Varia approached rosa as a tool for documentation but also as a
        social space. The role language played in server interactions was a
        very concrete translation of caring for and claiming that space.
        Because for some Varia members it was the first time using a
        terminal, while others already had experience, the language was
        something that they could all engage with. Varia recalls the
        language of the fresh Linux install was determining a certain
        hostility in the environment. This started with the ‘lecture file’
        that popped up after running the sudo command for the first time.
        The tone of the text just felt so out of proportion with what they
        were doing: they just had dinner, they were having a nice chat… and
        then — they got lectured. “Suddenly this other voice comes in that
        is taking over the space from a place we didn’t know was even
        there.” Changing certain texts, such as the sudo lecture file,
        renaming commands and tweaking welcome messages, was a way of making
        it more comfortable to move around rosa, through small scale
        interventions. The realization that you don’t have to take these
        wordings for granted was very inspiring and kept playing a role
        throughout the project.</p>
        <p>This reclaiming of the space by making it speak in a voice that
        was ours (the participants’) also happened through other means. One
        very risky but interesting move was giving everyone root privileges,
        erasing the power differences between users and administrators. This
        made room for other ways of doing, for instance, in dealing with
        errors and error pages. Normally, when someone tries to load a page
        that doesn’t exist or is run by a service that is currently not
        running, the server loads an error page, a dead end for the visitor.
        Because everyone had root, these pages could be rewritten to include
        instructions on how to fix the problem. There was a conversation
        about automating this process, for instance restarting
        etherpad-lite, but it was decided that this was not a desirable
        thing to do. Automating it makes it invisible, you lose a level of
        understanding. It’s one of the ways the seams of the patchwork are
        made visible and it transforms moving and replugging the server into
        a type of ritual: you plug it in, you start it and you manually
        start the services: “like you make the coffee, open the blinds and
        you welcome everyone inside.”</p>
        <p>Even though there wasn’t a specific environmental focus in how
        rosa was prepared, the server ended up quite lean because of its
        limited computational capacities. At first they were too limited,
        which meant the donated machine had to be replaced by a second-hand
        one because etherpad-lite needed a little bit more power when many
        people were working on documents at the same time. Using second-hand
        hardware was an environmentally significant choice, <a
        href="#making-do">making do</a> with what is already there, and to
        work <a href="#with-in-limits">With / in Limits</a> of the machine
        as well. Varia mentions that working with such a modest device was
        possible because rosa is thought of mainly for the role of
        documentation, allowing for more flexibility, also in terms of
        availability. rosa went offline every time they traveled. This
        adaptation to the context, this situated way of serving, challenges
        certain paradigms that cause environmental harm, such as expecting
        99.999% uptime and expecting servers to have the latest GPU and CPU
        no matter what the task at hand is. Certain tasks are essential and
        require this, but many more services could be approached in this
        flexible and situated way.</p>
        <p>Something Varia intended to do, and something that could help in
        keeping computationally heavy processes in check, was to monitor all
        the processes on rosa and make them more visible. They wanted to
        look at which things take up the most space, and if that space can
        be justified, to make the space more equal for all the other
        processes. This idea was triggered by a cronjob that was executed
        very often and started slowing everything on rosa down. Although
        they didn’t have time to work on this visualization, rosa did gain a
        voice, even several voices, in Graz. Listening to the server made
        them more present in the space. Pushing this idea further, the <a
        href="#ecofeminist-and-always-unfinished-space-making">making of
        space</a> for other processes (computational or other) could mean
        slowing down a cronjob to once a year. We started thinking about
        seasonal computing, something that doesn’t need to happen all year
        round, but only on one particular moment in time, on one specific
        location. Could computing be less like a 24/7 supermarket thing and
        be more seasonal — like you would go to an orchard to pick fruit
        once a year, you could go to this space where one special
        computational task is happening which would be dormant the rest of
        the time?</p>
        <h2 id="seismography-of-artistic-practices">Seismography of artistic
        practices</h2>
        <p><em>This description is based on two discussions I had with Reni
        Hofmüller and an email exchange with Nina Botthof of <a
        href="#esc-medien-kunst-labor">esc medien kunst labor
        (mkl)</a>.</em></p>
        <p>Esc medien kunst labor (esc mkl) proposed describing their work
        as a <a href="#seismography-of-artistic-practices">seismograph of
        artistic practises</a>: it observes and records artistic processes,
        recognizes the creative potential of artists within the current
        technological and socio-political developments, and promotes this
        work, making it visible to a broader audience and documenting the
        outcome. In our conversations and also in past encounters, esc has
        always been active in bridging different worlds, making connections
        between generations, localities, and contexts, bringing a diversity
        of people together around shared topics of concern. This
        seismography is not one that alerts us to impending disaster but to
        the building up and fostering of momentum within artistic, activist,
        and feminist practices.</p>
        <p>Reni Hofmüller, one of esc’s founders, spoke about how she uses
        resources as an entry point to discussions about technology, as a
        connecting element that ties labor, time, energy, sustainability,
        intersectionality, decoloniality, feminism, embodied and situated
        knowledge together. This means that, even in situations focusing on
        one specific struggle, we can’t forget the others; these struggles
        are all linked. Reni explains how she tries to have a holistic
        approach to the things she does, and one way to do that is by
        connecting it all to resources: resources of her own time and
        energy, the energy it takes to bring her from Graz to Rotterdam, for
        instance, the financial resources, and the responsibility towards
        others that have poured their time and energy into making this
        project happen. It’s a way to understand our surroundings. In each
        constellation resources are a big question, infrastructure is a big
        question. This is really important in her work – contextualizing
        what is done and thinking it through as situated knowledge. I felt
        this approach resonated a lot with ecofeminist thought, with
        something activist and scholar Greta Gaard wrote:</p>
        <blockquote>
        “As the slogan goes, ‘I’ll be post-feminist in the
        post-patriarchy’—and when sexism, heterosexism, transphobia,
        classism, racism, speciesism, ableism, ageism, and the global
        inequalities produced and exacerbated by industrial capitalism and
        the legacies of colonialism cease to be a problem, then feminism
        will have accomplished its goals and outlived its usefulness.” —
        Greta Gaard <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Reni has been part of this longer history of feminist tech
        events, servers, and networks. She (among many other things)
        co-founded mur.at in 1998, was part of Gender Changers Academy, and
        Eclectic Tech Carnival, which was hosted by esc in 2005<a
        href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. After more than two decades of
        bringing people together over nice food and feminist tech, she
        explains why she has this huge patience for learning together:</p>
        <blockquote>
        “because this is what learning is. If we don’t create these spaces
        where people can express ‘I have never done this before’, or ‘I
        don’t understand how that works’, or ‘it’s not working on my
        system’, then we can’t share it. If we want to share this other way
        of doing things, we also have to do it. Always. Networking takes
        time. It’s not only the machines, it’s also the people living a good
        life, and that means time and energy and everything that entails,
        with all our personalities.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>She joined this project with esc because she felt that this is
        the next generation of people who do things. She wanted to bring
        everything that people already thought about and tried out and
        experimented with, so that there is an access to lived history, all
        the contradictions and the doubts, the good and the bad things,
        everything that already happened, because for the new generation
        it’s something that can only be read about. Even though today things
        are created in a completely different setting, the questions remain
        the same: what is it that technology does to us and what could an
        active role in that look like? What could an infrastructure be that
        is reflecting <em>our</em> needs? She mentions how it is good to
        bridge this history while also being sensitive to what has changed.
        She sees this change most clearly in this real wish for collectivity
        in a way that <a
        href="#ecofeminist-and-always-unfinished-space-making">makes
        space</a> for others. It’s not only a wish, it is really a practice.
        The Code of Conduct at <a href="#varia">Varia</a>, for example, is
        really something that they live, part of how they do things and they
        have found ways to actually enact that. It’s not an abstract
        verbalization of something they aim for, it’s really part of how
        they do things. This is a huge change over the decades.</p>
        <h2 id="with-in-limits">With / in Limits</h2>
        <p><em>Based on two conversations I had with Wendy Van Wynsberghe,
        Élodie Mugrefya, and Martino Morandi of <a
        href="#constant">Constant</a>.</em></p>
        <p>Constant works with many terms, they have a habit of collecting
        words, of thinking in multiplicities. True to this, yet working <a
        href="#with-in-limits">With / in Limits</a>, they settled on three
        words that were part of their vocabulary already, and revisited them
        to see how they relate to environmental concerns. Environmental and
        social issues are so interconnected, and to me it’s interesting to
        see how taking care of small scale infrastructure in a thoughtful
        way has positive impacts across the board. Constant is thinking more
        and more in terms of these interconnections. When it comes to online
        content for instance, they aim to stay within the limits of the
        space they have on the server. They decided not to grow this space
        but to stick to what they already have. When they reach the maximum,
        they remove or downsize files. Constant has a long memory — they
        keep content from their entire history online and available — but
        this long presence is cheap in terms of space, because the older
        content is so small in comparison to content produced today. The
        more current practices are the problematic ones. Even though they
        max out their disk space occasionally, their system administrator
        will warn them in advance, giving them time to decide what to do
        instead of fixing it in a panic. They want to turn this into a
        protocol, into a regular practice.</p>
        <p>Linking environmental questions solely to CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions and electricity use pushes us into a small corner of
        metrics and narrow ways of engaging with alternative practices.
        Constant prefers a more holistic approach, because the most
        efficient forces are the ones that divert from the ‘cloud paradigm’,
        which might be super efficient, but propagates the narrative of
        unlimited and eternal use of services and storage. It pushes you to
        consume more. Constant is maybe less efficient but more aware of
        conditions of use, not pushing for more but working <a
        href="#with-in-limits">With / in Limits</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="speculative-libre-intersectional-technologies">Speculative
        Libre Intersectional Technologies</h3>
        <p>In the coming years, Constant will focus their work through this
        acronym: SPLINT, which stands for Speculative Libre Intersectional
        Technologies.</p>
        <blockquote>
        “Speculative Libre Intersectional Technologies is a term invented to
        signal Constant’s commitment to answer the question: What
        could/should free and intersectional technologies do? More
        specifically, what kinds of devices and practices could address and
        counteract the systemic discriminations, oppressions and exclusions
        at play in today’s technologies? SPLINT explores the potential of
        technology for artistic practice and vice versa, at the intersection
        of intersectional feminism and open source software. SPLINT
        investigates the discriminations and structural problems inherent in
        technology, and nurtures the imagination and imaginative capacity of
        techno-realities that can contribute to an open, experimental and
        equitable digital art field.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>The overarching aim is paying attention to where violence and
        oppression happen in society. They don’t want to define this word
        too much yet, because it is a striving, a goal for the coming years,
        it has yet to develop. I do love the acronym, something that allows
        mending something broken by temporarily supporting the structures
        around it. One clear environmental focus is interspecies
        relationships. This theme will be the main focus during one year but
        they aim to carry the sensitivity of this focus throughout the whole
        five year period. Another clearly environmental focus is techno
        disobedience, which relates to the question of resource use and
        e-waste. The term stems from Ernesto Orozo’s research on Cuban
        repair culture and the creative repurposing of old devices out of
        necessity and relates to <a href="#making-do">making do</a> with
        what is already there. <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"

        <h3 id="possible-ongoingness">Possible ongoingness</h3>
        <p>Possible ongoingness is the third term Constant felt resonated
        with their practice. It came up in a conversation between Donna
        Haraway and Carry Wolfe, and captures this striving to support and
        nourish practices that involve feeling responsible towards others
        and the world, to work towards something common in the midst of
        political polarization and climate catastrophe.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Carry Wolfe: “Let’s start with a problem that we all agree we
        share”.</p>
        Donna Harraway: “We all share this problem, and we all have very
        different ideas about what to do about it. That’s already hard
        enough. That does not mean the science is not settled on climate
        change, or that relativism reigns; it does mean learning to compose
        possible ongoingness inside relentlessly diffracting worlds. And we
        need resolutely to keep cosmopolitical practices going here,
        focusing on those practices that can build a common-enough world.” —
        Haraway and Wolfe, 2016 <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
        </blockquote>
        <p>One way Constant practices this is through the sharing of their
        infrastructure with others. Etherpad, for instance, is shared with
        many organizations and people. Sometimes they find out that people
        encounter Constant uniquely through their etherpad service and only
        later find out they are an actual organization that does other
        things too. Big Blue Button (BBB) followed a similar pattern. At
        first it became a necessity for Constant itself because of the first
        lockdown. They needed it and had the resources to set it up. They
        decided to share it. Everyone who wanted to use it could book a
        timeslot in the agenda. This resulted in a large diversity of groups
        and individuals making use of it, from activist groups to students
        and more. They have an archive of the reservations, which has become
        potential evidence to show to those who refuse to consider
        alternatives to big tech. It demonstrates that it works and that
        there is a real need and interest. Environmentally, it is a great
        idea to share resources — not everyone needs to have their own
        server with BBB and etherpad. Besides, this sharing also strengthens
        relations between people and organizations, building <a
        href="#networks-of-care-and-trust">networks of care and
        trust</a>.</p>
        <p>There is an element of care in the way they treat these shared
        services. Etherpads that are not used for a year are turned static,
        colors are removed, as well as the history of all edits of the page,
        which together saves a lot of space. These space saving methods were
        a result of the database growing too much. This seemingly small and
        practical gesture could have a big impact if it were practiced more
        widely; refusing to grow storage space and instead looking for ways
        to stay <a href="#with-in-limits">With / in Limits</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="ecofeminist-servers">Ecofeminist Servers</h2>
        <p>There is no such thing as an ecofeminist server, at least there
        isn’t one identified as such as far as I know. That’s ok, this
        dictionary is full of terms that did not exist yet. It is also not
        about servers but about the language we use to speak about how we
        use them, the narratives shared. I used the term ecofeminist because
        there is a rich discourse around feminist servers and there is one
        about sustainability and ICT, and I wanted to explore if and how
        they connect while simultaneously and briefly exploring the term
        ecofeminism itself.</p>
        <p>I am aware of the turbulent history of the term and the very
        diverse academic and activist practices associated with it. I’m
        inspired by Miriam Bahaffou and Julie Gorecki’s introduction to the
        New French Edition of <em>La Feminisme ou La Mort</em> by Francoise
        D’Eaubonne <a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>. They describe how, for them,
        there is a clear connection between the treatment of nature and that
        of women, the enslaved, disabled, and racialized. All are treated as
        terrain of experimentation or conquest. They point out the whiteness
        of ecofeminism’s history and show how colonization is painfully
        absent from the writings of Francoise d’Eaubonne, who coined the
        term in 1972. They dismiss the apolitical, ahistorical type of
        ecofeminism that reproduces white privilege as well as the equally
        privileged DIY lifestyles that require materials created under
        horrible conditions by workers on the other side of the world. Yet
        they see potential in d’Eaubonne’s call to link theory and practice
        and celebrate calls for “feminist system change not climate change”
        by women and gender minorities around the world.</p>

        <p>The practices described in this tiny dictionary are specific to
        their local context yet share the desire to connect the struggle
        against different oppressions and to transform this desire into ways
        of doing: something biologist and activist Max Liboiron calls
        axiology-in-praxis, in Pollution is Colonialism <a href="#fn22"

        role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>. Liboiron describes the way
        CLEAR lab approaches anti-colonialism as land relations at the scale
        of protocol. It is impossible to confront land theft and ongoing
        colonial violence when you’re doing everyday research in a lab, but
        you can manifest your values in the way you do your daily work

        knowledges and experiences. She argues that, in certain contexts, a
        dismissal of local knowledges in favor of the imperative of total
        system change can become a way to shut down discussion and avoid
        having to think about how our own practices reproduce inequalities:
        “It is easy to conclude that technologies are colonised and
        colonising. But it’s hard to accept that we, to some extent, are
        too.”<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
        <p>A decolonial ecofeminism applied to tech infrastructure can be a
        way to think through resistance to these connected oppressions at
        multiple scales; from creating safe online spaces for marginalized
        communities to political action demanding supply chain transparency
        and repairable devices out of care for a damaged earth and in
        solidarity with those who mined the raw materials and worked to
        produce the devices needed to accommodate those safe online
        spaces.</p>

        Of Feminist Servers</h2>
        <p>The project A Traversal Network of Feminist Servers (ATNOFS) took
        place in 2022 at six locations across Europe. Its main protagonist
        was rosa, a tiny local server that hopped on and off trains,
        disappearing from the network only to reappear again shortly
        after.</p>
        <p>ATNOFS was a collaboration between <a
        href="#the-communities">several communities</a> that wished to take
        time to exchange ideas, skills, and knowledge about intersectional,
        feminist, ecological servers, wanting to break communication and
        culture out of corporate capture by media oligopolies.</p>
        <blockquote>
        “From the beginning, the goal of ATNOFS has been to set up a
        long-term collaboration framework together with a growing network of
        associations of people interested in, or already active within,
        self-hosting federated practices that follow feminist,
        intersectional principles. The project responded to the need for
        continuity, interrelation and support for self-hosted and
        self-organised computational infrastructures in The Netherlands,
        Romania, Austria, Greece and Belgium. This work is especially
        inspired by the tenets of the Feminist Server Manifesto.”<a

        <p>During the year, six physical meetings were held, called

        in Bucharest, Romania. It is an unfinished project. They are still
        writing their story. hypha is a non-homogenous group of individuals.
        The people taking part in hypha meetings are joined by the curiosity
        to explore technology with both curiosity and critique. hypha
        meetings have been informal. They discussed subjects that emerged
        naturally from their lived experience. Their understanding and
        relationship with technology differs from person to person. This
        created a space of diverse opinions. They have held space for their
        differences, and they have held each other through learning about
        the things that they struggled with. They also gathered to watch and
        discuss movies — curated documentaries about hacking culture. These
        stories sparked further explorations […] <a href="#fn28"

        <p><a href="https://varia.zone/">Varia</a> is a collective space in
        Rotterdam focused on everyday technologies. They believe technology
        shouldn’t be the exclusive domain of specialists. It affects
        everyone and should enable, rather than preclude, diverse ways of
        living. Focusing on everyday technology means questioning the
        hierarchies in place within technical objects and therefore the
        valorization of skills needed to design or use these objects. This
        means reconsidering the hegemony of high tech: cheap, artisanal
        solutions are their method of choice.</p>

        organizes research meetings and workshops around technology and
        feminism, enabling diverse activities such as sociopolitical
        discussions, prototyping, skill sharing, and experimenting with
        various artistic practices. Feminist pedagogies and Free, Libre, and
        Open Source Software ideas of sharing inspire their working methods.

        <p><a href="https://lurk.org">LURK</a> started out as a small
        collective of artists / hackers, cultural workers, art, sound, and
        design practitioners (from makers to writers) interested in
        facilitating and archiving discussions around net- and computational
        culture and politics, proto- and post-free culture practices,
        (experimental) (sound) (new media) (software) art, and other such
        topics. They have been active since 2014, and today they are best
        described as both a collective and a community of communities.
        Practically speaking, they offer, to like-minded people and peers,
        the possibility to host their email discussion lists, access instant
        messaging services, participate on alternative social media
        platforms, as well as make use of an audio and video streaming
        server for events, radios, and miscellaneous experiments.</p>

        <p><a href="https://esc.mur.at/">esc medien kunst labor</a> (esc
        mkl) is an art initiative, a cultural organization, and exhibition
        space based in the city center of Graz, Austria. While its main task
        is the production of art, it also puts emphasis on the observation
        and capturing of artistic processes. The artistic activities of esc
        mkl are determined by the fact that art is understood as a subsystem
        of social and societal reality. As a hub for the exchange of ideas,
        esc mkl serves to network between artists, scientists, theorists,
        and many more while also providing infrastructure, technical
        support, and advice. Furthermore, exhibitions contribute to the
        public awareness of art and promote artists.</p>

        <p><a href="https://constantvzw.org/">Constant</a> is an association
        for arts and media run by artists, designers, researchers, and
        hackers based in Brussels, Belgium. Constant works to systematically
        create collaborative situations that engage with the challenges of
        contemporary techno-life. At Constant, they develop projects at the
        intersections of art and technology in which, for them, it is
        important to make connections between intersectional feminisms, free
        software, and copyleft approaches. Together, these allow them to
        imagine webs of interdependencies, infrastructures of solidarity,
        poetic algorithms, conflicted data processing practices, and
        principles for multi- and/or fuzzy authorship. For them, generating
        puzzling questions is a strategy that offers openings for profound,
        complex, and playful research. These questions are stumbling blocks
        that help them realize that the technologies they are interested in
        are not about fluency, smoothness, optimization, and efficiency, but
        are instead full of assumptions and problems that demand our
        continuous attention<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
