  <!-- About -------------------------------------------------->

  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    Solar Protocol is a web platform hosted across a network of solar-powered
    servers set up in different locations around the world. A solar-powered
    server is a computer that is powered by a solar panel and a small battery.
    Each server can only offer intermittent connectivity that is dependent on
    available sunshine, the length of day and local weather conditions. When
    connected as a network, the servers coordinate to serve a website from
    whichever of them is enjoying the most sunshine at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    With servers located in different time zones, seasons and weather systems,
    the network directs internet traffic to wherever the sun is shining. When
    your browser makes a request to see this website, it is sent to whichever
    server in the network is generating the most energy. For example, right now
    you are seeing the version of this website that is hosted on {{name}} server
    located in {{location}} where it is {{time}} and the weather is {{weather}}.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Solar Protocol network explores the sun’s interaction with Earth as a
    form of logic that shapes the daily behaviors, seasonal activities and the
    decision making of almost all life forms. Solar Protocol honors this natural
    logic, exploring it as a form of intelligence that is used to automate
    decisions in a digital network.
  </p>
  <h4>How does it work?</h4>
  <p>
    A solar panel recharges a battery that provides energy for a small computer
    set up at each project location around the world. As the sun rises and sets,
    each server becomes active or inactive as its solar panel goes into sunlight
    or darkness. Traffic is redirected between servers depending on where there
    is the most light.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solar Protocol uses everyday internet technologies like the Domain Network
    Service (DNS) protocol, a decentralized system that associates a URL address
    to the IP address of a server. In short, DNS is the system that dictates the
    path between client and server. For large-scale, high volume web services
    that use multiple servers hosted in different locations, the DNS protocol
    typically directs network traffic to whichever server gives the quickest
    response time. For example, when making a Google search, your request would
    be sent to whichever Google server responds the quickest which is usually
    the server that is the closest geographically. This prioritizes speed over
    all other factors that determine how a network operates, a characteristic
    that is prevalent in much digital culture.

<div class="onecol-text">
  <p>
    But it doesn’t have to work this way. Instead, the Solar Protocol network is
    built with a different logic based on the sun, automatically directing
    traffic to whichever server is generating the most solar energy at the time
    of the request. Decisions about where to move computational activity in the
    network are made according to where there is the most naturally available
    energy, rather than according to what would produce the quickest results for
    the user. In other words, in Solar Protocol, the distribution of sunshine
    (and therefore energy) across the planet determines the path from client to
    server.
  </p>

  <h4>Why does the appearance of this website change from time to time?</h4>
  <p>
    Right now this website is being delivered to you from the {{name}} server
    located in {{location}}. This website may look different depending on which
    server is displaying this website. That’s because the people stewarding each
    server can choose to customize their local version of this website. These
    variations in design and content are visible when their server is the active
    server.
  </p>
  <p>
    The appearance of this website is also energy responsive. Our software
    changes the styling and resolution of the media on this website according to
    how much energy is stored in the battery of the active server. This means it
    may look different at different times of the day or depending on the seasons
    of the year. If the battery level at the active server is low, this website
    is displayed in low resolution mode, without images. This reduces the size
    of the page and therefore the energy required to send it to people who are
    looking at it on the internet. If more stored energy is available, the site
    will appear at a higher resolution with heavier media such as images and
    graphics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Occasionally the website may go down if there is insufficient energy stored
    at all of the servers. As our network grows and we set up more servers in
    more time zones and climates, this should happen less and less (and if
    you’re interested in setting one up,
    <a href="/call.html">read more here</a>
    ). It’s always sunny somewhere!

    The Solar Protocol project is maintained by a community of volunteers around
    the world who have set up servers in different locations and timezones. If
    you are interested in hosting a server, please see our
    <a href="call.html">call for stewards</a>
    and read the FAQ closely. It can be suprisingly difficult to find an
    appropriate and secure location for the server.
