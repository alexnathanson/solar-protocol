          Scholars and activists mobilize increasingly the term degrowth when

          development. Degrowth signals a radical political and economic
          reorganization leading to reduced resource and energy use.

          The sun, which, since Antiquity, has played an essential role in our
          utopian imaginations, is the ultimate source of energy, both
          productive and destructive. According to Georges Bataille, its
          infinite generosity can be taken as the model for human societies,
          which suggests an alternative to the capitalist economy with its
          infinite expansion, colonization, and disastrous consequences on the
          cosmic scale.
