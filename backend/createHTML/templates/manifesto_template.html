  <h4>Natural Intelligence</h4>
  <p>
    Solar Protocol reconfigures internet protocols using natural rather
    than artificial intelligence. When visiting most large internet
    platforms today, decisions about what content you see are automated
    with a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning.
    Machine learning systems are trained on massive datasets collected
    via online surveillance. They produce logic from patterns within
    their data and use this logic to automate decisions. Most large web
    platforms collect data from every click, view and scroll and then
    use this data to automate decisions about what content to show their
    users. In contrast to this, on the Solar Protocol platform,
    decisions about what content is served is automated with a logic
    produced by available sunshine and energy. The network operates with
    a natural intelligence that emerges from the intermittent dynamics
    of our shared environment.

    Our current imagination for the internet and computing at large, has
    been shaped by the energy systems that power it. Cheap, fossil fuel
    energy has produced a culture that celebrates speed and ever larger,
    heavier media. These energy systems have also made current forms of
    artificial intelligence possible. As the author Timothy Mitchell
    observes, different energy regimes create different political
    possibilities and limitations [1]. In Solar Protocol, by changing
    the way a computer network is powered, we aim to expand the
    imaginative potential for what the internet could be, as well as reshaping 
    expectations of it. Other worlds are possible.2

    Working with small solar powered servers makes it advantageous to
    reduce the size of the website that you want to serve as much as
    possible. This is why we have omitted energy-intensive tracking
    technologies which forecloses the possibility of online surveillance
    and the online business models that go with it.[3] Solar power
    therefore encourages a lighter internet that is customized to
    collective environmental conditions rather than individual user
    behavior.

    By reconfiguring internet protocols with the logic of the sun, Solar
    Protocol seeks to create a space for working with natural
    intelligence and exploring it might change our relationship to the
    internet for the better.

    the age of oil (2011), that discusses the political consequences of
    different energy systems. </p>

    Fungal Revolts (2020).

    Website published by Low Tech Magazine (2019) and we have taken much
    inspiration from this groundbreaking project.
