  <h3>What do you need to install a small scale solar system?</h3>
  <p>
    A server takes care, maitenance and stewardship as well as specific physical
    conditions and network connectivity.
  </p>
  <h5>What sort of site do you need for a small scale solar system?</h5>

  <ul>
    <li>
      To install a system you will need a safe and accessible outdoor area that
      is exposed to direct sunlight for at least 4 hours per day (this means a
      spot that is free from obstructions/shadows and ideally facing the
      equator)
    </li>
    <li>
      The solar panel needs to be safely secured to a wall, pole or rooftop so
      it doesn't blow away or get stolen
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>What sort of connectivity do you need to run a server?</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The server needs Internet access either via ethernet cable or wifi
      (minimum network speed: 25mb/s up & 25mb/s down)
    </li>
    <li>
      You need to be able to set up port forwarding for both http (port 80) and
      ssh (port 20) with your Internet Service Provider to serve the solar
      protocol network publically
    </li>
  </ul>
