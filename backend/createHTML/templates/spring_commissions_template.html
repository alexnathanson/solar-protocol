  <h2>Spring 2023 Commissions</h2>
  
  <p>After a huge response to our open call, we are pleased to announce the first Solar Protocol project commissions. Congratulations Hakeem Adam, Marloes de Valk, Rory Gillen and Anna Madeleine Raupach, Mark Anthony Hernández Motaghy, Jen Liu, Kristin Lucas and Joe McKay, Everest Pipkin, Brian Sutherland, Roopa Vasudevan and Denzel Wamburu. </p>
    
   <p> In the first months of 2023, this group will be developing new work exploring issues and questions relating to self-hosted networks, the materiality of computation, intermittency and the temporal qualities of solar power. We will be presenting what emerges in an online exhibition in late Spring.</p>
