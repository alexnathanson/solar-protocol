# What kind of projects can run on Solar Protocol?

There are many types of projects that can be created with Solar Protocol for education and creative purposes. Some can be done completely indendently while others require various levels of collaboration with us.

One way to categorize the types of possible projects are as external, single server, or network. For reasons that will be clear as you read on, external projects are the simplest to produce, single server projects are a little more complicated, and network projects can potentially get very complex.

## External Projects

External projects are purely client side projects. These project use the publicly available open API (insert link to API tutorial) to get data from Solar Protocol and do something with it. The software running these projects is generally not running on a server in the Solar Protocol network. Because these projects can run anywhere with publically available data, you do not need to coordinate with or get permission from us (though we'd love to learn about them).

To learn more about developing an external project, check out the API tutorial.

## Single Server Projects

A single server project is a project that runs on a Solar Protocol server. In addition to the open API, these projects make use of something specific to the server they are running on. There are a number of technical and conceptual reasons a project might need to run directly on a Solar Protocol server. For example, it might require additional types of data that aren't available on the public API or it might be engaging with the specific geographic location, materiality, or intermittency of the server itself.

One example of a single server project is the Low Carbon Methods website, which embraces intermittency and uses energy-centered design principles to communicate energetic aspects of the servers.

## Network Projects

Network projects require either being hosted on multiple servers or engage with some aspect of the network's characterstics, beyond simply what is available via the open API. A project may need to run on multiple servers for reliability reasons or to take advantage of the unique Solar Protocol network characteristics.

These projects are typically the most complex to implement and can require additional scaffholding and backend software development.

## More Info

Note that there are also instances where a project is hosted on one or more Solar Protocol servers, but it could also exist as an external project because it only requires the public data. This might be because it was commissioned by Solar Protocol, is a mission aligned project that we wanted to support, or simply a personal project from someone involved in Solar Protocol.
