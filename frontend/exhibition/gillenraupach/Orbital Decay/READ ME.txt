Hey Anna, 

Now everything is unzipped you should be able to just click the index.html 
file and the site should pop up in your browser and look like screenshot 1. 

If that doesnt work or the full site doesnt load (mainly the table of satellites)
you'll have to visit https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
and click the box requesting temporary access to the demo server. 

This is just a temporary workaround I had to put in place to make everything front-end 
and hopefully either us or the Solar Protocol crew will be able to patch it into 
their server infrastructure. 

Hope it all works, and look forward to hearing back soon! 

Cheers, 

Rory
