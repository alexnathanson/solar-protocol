        Solar Protocol is an experimental network of solar powered servers
        installed at different locations around the world. As the sun rises and
        sets, each server turns on and off as its solar panel
        goes into sunlight or darkness. This website is hosted on the network and traffic is directed to whichever server is enjoying
        the most sunlight at the time the request for this page is made. Different parts of this site are distributed across the network and made available at different times of
        the day, depending on which server is active. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The system directs traffic using the Domain Network Service (DNS)
        protocol, a decentralized system that resolves a URL to an IP address of
        a server. In short, DNS dictates the path between client and server.
        Typically high volume web services like Google or Facebook will
        configure the DNS to direct network traffic to different servers based
        on their response times which is ususally a proxy for the sending traffic to the server that is geographically closest. However on the Solar Protocol network, traffic is automatically directed to whichever server has the most solar energy available. The network detirmines the path from client to server based on the distribution of sunshine (and therefore energy) across the planet.

      <h3>Natural intelligences</h3>
    <p>
    Solar Protocol reconfigures internet protocols using natural intelligence rather than artificial intelligence. Presently, much attention is focused on automating decisions based on logics derived from massive datasets produced by systems of surveillance capitalism. Web platforms monitor our behavior and use this data to make decisions about what content we will see next. Instead, on the Solar Protocol platform decisions about what content is served, are automated with a logic produced by the sun’s position. The network leverages a natural intelligence that emerges from the intermittent dynamics of our shared environment. </p>
    <p>
    Both digital surveillance and machine learning are intelligences only made possible by a society dependent on cheap energy from fossil fuels. Relying on solar energy to power our servers, means the pages served on this network must be kept small in size and have to omit energy-intensive tracking technologies. Solar powered sites are therefore fast, light and private.</p>
    <p>
    Solar Protocol is a space to contend with the internet as produced by an interplay between the social, ecological and technological, and to reimagine it anew.
