          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Solar Protocol is a web platform hosted across a network of
            solar-powered servers set up in different locations around the
            world. A solar-powered server is a computer that is powered by a
            solar panel and a small battery. Each server can only offer
            intermittent connectivity that is dependent on available sunshine,
            the length of day and local weather conditions. When connected as a
            network, the servers coordinate to serve a website from whichever of
            them is enjoying the most sunshine at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            With servers located in different time zones, seasons and weather
            systems, the network directs internet traffic to wherever the sun is
            shining. When your browser makes a request to see this website, it
            is sent to whichever server in the network is generating the most
            energy. For example, right now you are seeing the version of this
            website that is hosted on Pizza Rat server located in Coney Island
            where it is 06:33 PM and the weather is n/a.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Solar Protocol network explores the sun’s interaction with Earth
            as a form of logic that shapes the daily behaviors, seasonal
            activities and the decision making of almost all life forms. Solar
            Protocol honors this natural logic, exploring it as a form of
            intelligence that is used to automate decisions in a digital
            network.
          </p>
          <h4>How does it work?</h4>
          <p>
            A solar panel recharges a battery that provides energy for a small
            computer set up at each project location around the world. As the
            sun rises and sets, each server becomes active or inactive as its
            solar panel goes into sunlight or darkness. Traffic is redirected
            between servers depending on where there is the most light.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solar Protocol uses everyday internet technologies like the Domain
            Network Service (DNS) protocol, a decentralized system that
            associates a URL address to the IP address of a server. In short,
            DNS is the system that dictates the path between client and server.
            For large-scale, high volume web services that use multiple servers
            hosted in different locations, the DNS protocol typically directs
            network traffic to whichever server gives the quickest response
            time. For example, when making a Google search, your request would
            be sent to whichever Google server responds the quickest which is
            usually the server that is the closest geographically. This
            prioritizes speed over all other factors that determine how a
            network operates, a characteristic that is prevalent in much digital
            culture.
          </p>

        <div class="onecol-text">
          <div class="caption">
            The position of sun relative to earth produces the routing logic of
            the network.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="onecol-text">
          <p>
            But it doesn’t have to work this way. Instead, the Solar Protocol
            network is built with a different logic based on the sun,
            automatically directing traffic to whichever server is generating
            the most solar energy at the time of the request. Decisions about
            where to move computational activity in the network are made
            according to where there is the most naturally available energy,
            rather than according to what would produce the quickest results for
            the user. In other words, in Solar Protocol, the distribution of
            sunshine (and therefore energy) across the planet determines the
            path from client to server.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Why does the appearance of this website change from time to time?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Right now this website is being delivered to you from the Pizza Rat
            server located in Coney Island. This website may look different
            depending on which server is displaying this website. That’s because
            the people stewarding each server can choose to customize their
            local version of this website. These variations in design and
            content are visible when their server is the active server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The appearance of this website is also energy responsive. Our
            software changes the styling and resolution of the media on this
            website according to how much energy is stored in the battery of the
            active server. This means it may look different at different times
            of the day or depending on the seasons of the year. If the battery
            level at the active server is low, this website is displayed in low
            resolution mode, without images. This reduces the size of the page
            and therefore the energy required to send it to people who are
            looking at it on the internet. If more stored energy is available,
            the site will appear at a higher resolution with heavier media such
            as images and graphics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally the website may go down if there is insufficient energy
            stored at all of the servers. As our network grows and we set up
            more servers in more time zones and climates, this should happen
            less and less (and if you’re interested in setting one up,
            <a href="/call.html">read more here</a>
            ). It’s always sunny somewhere!
          </p>

            The Solar Protocol project is maintained by a community of
            volunteers around the world who have set up servers in different
            locations and timezones. If you are interested in hosting a server,
            please see our
            <a href="call.html">call for stewards</a>
            and read the FAQ closely. It can be suprisingly difficult to find an
            appropriate and secure location for the server.
