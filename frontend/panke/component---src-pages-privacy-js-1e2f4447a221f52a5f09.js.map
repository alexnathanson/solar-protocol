The collection of this data is necessary in\n                  order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail\n                  address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore\n                  serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                  The personal data collected as part of a registration for the\n                  newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In\n                  addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by\n                  e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the\n                  newsletter service or a registration in question, as this\n                  could be the case in the event of modifications to the\n                  newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical\n                  circumstances.

Newsletter-Tracking</h3>\n                <p>\n                  The newsletter of the panke.gallery – Verein für\n                  künstlerisch-kulturelle Bildung e.V. contains so-called\n                  tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic\n                  embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to\n                  enable log file recording and analysis. This allows a\n                  statistical analysis of the success or failure of online\n                  marketing campaigns. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the\n                  panke.gallery – Verein für künstlerisch-kulturelle Bildung\n                  e.V. may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data\n                  subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data\n                  subjects.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                  Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained\n                  in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller\n                  in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well\n                  as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to\n                  the interests of the data subject. These personal data will\n                  not be passed on to third parties. Data subjects are at any\n                  time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of\n                  consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure. After\n                  a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the\n                  controller. The panke.gallery – Verein für\n                  künstlerisch-kulturelle Bildung e.V. automatically regards a\n                  withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3>6.

Legal basis for the processing </h3>\n                <p>\n                  Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing\n                  operations for which we obtain consent for a specific\n                  processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is\n                  necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data\n                  subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing\n                  operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide\n                  any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1)\n                  lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations\n                  which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures,\n                  for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products\n                  or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by\n                  which processing of personal data is required, such as for the\n                  fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on\n                  Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of\n                  personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests\n                  of the data subject or of another natural person. This would\n                  be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our\n                  company and his name, age, health insurance data or other\n                  vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor,\n                  hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be\n                  based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations\n                  could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis\n                  is used for processing operations which are not covered by any\n                  of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is\n                  necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued\n                  by our company or by a third party, except where such\n                  interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental\n                  rights and freedoms of the data subject which require\n                  protection of personal data. Such processing operations are\n                  particularly permissible because they have been specifically\n                  mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a\n                  legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a\n                  client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n                </p>\n\n                <h3>\n                  11.

Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract\n                  that the data subject provides us with personal data, which\n                  must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for\n                  example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our\n                  company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of\n                  the personal data would have the consequence that the contract\n                  with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal\n                  data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must\n                  contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data\n                  subject whether the provision of the personal data is required\n                  by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the\n                  contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the\n                  personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the\n                  personal data.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3>14.
