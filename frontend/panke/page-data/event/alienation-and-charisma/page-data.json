The film will be screened in cooperation with Videoart at Midnight at Babylon Berlin, and framed by an exhibition at <a href=\"https://www.panke.gallery/rosa\">/rosa</a>.</p>\n<p>In the frame of their two-month residency period for GameChanger, Omsk Social Club explored the soft underbelly of collective order, consensus and legitimacy through a Real Game Play set in a satirical possible near future scenario. Springboarding off the book “Alienation and Charisma: A Study of Contemporary American Communes” by Benjamin Zablocki, they dove into the manner in which alienation and charisma are generative in the emergence of collectivity.</p>\n<p>17:00-21:00 exhibition opening at /rosa Gallery, Rosa-Luxemburg-Strasse 35, 10178 Berlin (the exhibition stays on until December 22nd)\n18:00-19:45 film screenings at <a href=\"https://babylonberlin.eu/\">Babylon Berlin</a>, Rosa-Luxemburg-Strasse 30, 10178 Berlin (exact screening times to be announced)</p>\n<p>From the 8th of December, the movie will be available on the online screening platform pylon-lab for two weeks: <a href=\"https://pylon-hub.com/lab\">https://pylon-hub.com/lab</a></p>\n<p>More information about the event: <a href=\"https://gamechanger.land/events/start-of-the-residency-of-omsk-social-club\">https://gamechanger.land/events/start-of-the-residency-of-omsk-social-club</a></p>"}},"furtherInformationBlocks":[{"id":"fb12939c-b9da-58b9-a10f-6e88e4d80233","title":"About GameChanger","childContentfulContentBlockBlockContentTextNode":{"id":"37d9b34b-eaba-52d0-adfc-4387d2f1ad6f","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>GameChanger</strong> is a research and mediation project extending from March 2022 till February 2023. The aim of the project is to explore contemporary mindsets and practices of self-organisation in the arts. As a collaborative research methodology, it hosts a series of three artist residencies, carving out a space to exchange, prototype and self-reflect about the alternative economic and governance models that are being developed for and by the art commons.

These worlds bleed into one. That is where Omsk positions their speculative fictions, through these immersive installations they move into a territory they coined in 2017 called Real Game Play (RGP). Their work aims to induce states that could potentially be a fiction or a yet, unlived reality.</p>\n<p>Omsk works closely with networks of viewers, everything is unique and unrehearsed. The living installations they create examine virtual egos, popular experiences and political phenomena. Allowing the works to become a dematerialized hybrid of modern-day culture alongside the participant's unique personal experiences. In the past Omsk Social Club’s Real Game Play immersive environments have introduced landscapes and topics such as otherkin, rave culture, survivalism, catfishing, desire&#x26;sacrifice, positive trolling, algorithmic strategies and decentralized cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>They have exhibited across Europe in various institutions, galleries, theatres and off-sites such as Martin Gropius Bau, House of Electronic Kunst Basel, HKW, Berlin, Seventeen, London Volksbühne, Berlin, Stroom den Haag, Den Haag the Netherlands and Light Art Space Berlin. They have been included in CTM Festival (2021), 34th Ljubljana Biennial (2021) 6th Athens Biennale (2018), Transmediale Festival (2019), The Influencers (2018) and Impakt Festival (2018). In 2021 they co-curated the 7th Athens Biennale with Larry Ossei-Mensah.</p>"}}}],"featuredImage":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=750&h=422&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=1050&h=591&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=1080&h=608&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1080w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=1366&h=769&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1366w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=1920&h=1081&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=1050&h=591&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=750&h=422&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=1050&h=591&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=1080&h=608&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1080w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=1366&h=769&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1366w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/5B7CHpuNKnNpMulcyQx9zN/a4b9e451d5b064ead945738f0162e511/GameChanger_Alienation_and_Charisma__c__Omsk_Social_Club.jpg?w=1920&h=1081&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"transparent","width":1050,"height":591,"placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"}}},"eventImpressionsSlideshow":null,"eventDocumentationImagesBelow":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"alienation-and-charisma"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
