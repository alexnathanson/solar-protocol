This is an invitation to consider possible ways forward in the debate around data while asking questions. How could this work? Do we even want this? Can a technological socialism exist or escape capitalism and this uniquely Californian brand of violence?  Would this even lead to a positive outcome that disrupts established hierarchies or would each individual, each node, or the cooperative become another profit-seeking agent caught in the cycle of a market economy to its own detriment? Are we even able to contemplate a utopia or a preferred world, or are we condemned to dystopia and critique?</p>"}},"furtherInformationBlocks":[{"id":"e4b4c333-2075-510b-8838-545061279a86","title":"Participant","childContentfulContentBlockBlockContentTextNode":{"id":"ababe783-e7f6-5ced-9ccf-deace0ce9399","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Ela Kagel</strong>\nDigital strategist Ela Kagel specialises in the intersection of society, technology and economy. Since the 1990s she has produced media art exhibitions, designed spaces for cultural exchange and helped establish digital platforms, networks and communities . She is a long-time collaborator and researcher at the Public Art Lab in Berlin. From 2009 to 2011 she was program curator for the Transmediale Festival for Art and Digital Culture in Berlin. While at Transmediale Ela developed the Free Culture Incubator, a series of workshops and events based on free and open culture. Central to Ela’s practice is supporting bottom-up initiatives deeply rooted in particular communities of practice. From this perspective she also established and curated Upgrade! Berlin, as well as a number of commons-related research projects. In 2010 Ela co-founded SUPERMARKT, an independent hub for digital culture and collaborative economy. Ela is co-initiator of the #Platformcoop Berlin meetups. Since 2018, Ela is also board member of RChain Europe, a technology cooperative based in Berlin.</p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer Lyn Morone</strong> is an artist, activist, and design researcher whose work focuses on the human experience in relation to technology, economics, politics, and identity and the moral and ethical issues that arise from such systems. Her interests lie in exploring ways of creating social justice and equal distribution of the future.  In 2014, Morone founded Jennifer Lyn Morone™ Inc (JLM Inc) – including ‘Extreme Capitalism’ and ‘DOME’ — as an ongoing project to protest against data exploitation and corporate personhood.  Her approach with this project often takes principles of individualised Western civilisation to an extreme form, imitating and in doing so parodies various strategies, language, and dogma taking the entire system to the outer boundaries of its absurdity.  She works multi-disciplinarily and with multiple mediums – from video, graphics, books, data, laws, businesses, and the body.  She is currently working on stories of post-work worlds that ask how we want to live, and she is leading the non-profit RadicalxChange Foundation. She is based in Germany.</p>"}}}],"featuredImage":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4u4p4vWFVuhLR4tmVHdep6/5604f68103a839cd8a0e27e18a0ea31c/poster_coop.png?w=750&h=484&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4u4p4vWFVuhLR4tmVHdep6/5604f68103a839cd8a0e27e18a0ea31c/poster_coop.png?w=1050&h=678&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4u4p4vWFVuhLR4tmVHdep6/5604f68103a839cd8a0e27e18a0ea31c/poster_coop.png?w=1080&h=697&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1080w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4u4p4vWFVuhLR4tmVHdep6/5604f68103a839cd8a0e27e18a0ea31c/poster_coop.png?w=1115&h=720&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1115w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4u4p4vWFVuhLR4tmVHdep6/5604f68103a839cd8a0e27e18a0ea31c/poster_coop.png?w=1050&h=678&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4u4p4vWFVuhLR4tmVHdep6/5604f68103a839cd8a0e27e18a0ea31c/poster_coop.png?w=750&h=484&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4u4p4vWFVuhLR4tmVHdep6/5604f68103a839cd8a0e27e18a0ea31c/poster_coop.png?w=1050&h=678&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4u4p4vWFVuhLR4tmVHdep6/5604f68103a839cd8a0e27e18a0ea31c/poster_coop.png?w=1080&h=697&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent 1080w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4u4p4vWFVuhLR4tmVHdep6/5604f68103a839cd8a0e27e18a0ea31c/poster_coop.png?w=1115&h=720&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent 1115w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"transparent","width":1050,"height":678,"placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"}}},"eventImpressionsSlideshow":null,"eventDocumentationImagesBelow":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"coop-panel"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
