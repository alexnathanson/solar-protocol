It originated during the WWII indicating that partisans in action had to come up with solutions under extremely unfavourable conditions. The question, when given instructions for an impossible mission, would often be \"but how do I do that?\", and the answer would often be \"figure it out, comrade\". Later during the socialist period, this expression would be used for practices that people were devising when encountering bureaucratic or material constraints in everyday life. All periods and societies have such practices of common lying, cheating and stealing and common phrases to name them.</p>\n<p>FIO is a collective exploration of stories of ingenuity that people with little or no power devise when systems fail them. The evening at panke.gallery is focused on the inginuity of workers in the global gig factory. Particularly on tactics the workers on platforms such as Microwork, Amazon Turk or Upwork based in the Eastern Europe and the Global South contrive to fake their location or presence to cirumvent scant pay, surveillance and control that is frequently not expected from the gig workers in the Western Europe and the Global North.</p>\n<p>The upcoming event features a talk by Aleksandra Lakić, introducing her and Saša Savanović's research on the socio-economic situation and labor conditions in platform economy in South Eastern Europe. The talk will also assess the impact of algorithmic management and surveillance as factors contributing to declining quality of work on digital labour platforms. A second presentation will be held by the researcher Max Haiven, who has recently collaborated with rank-and-file Amazon workers to write and publish short, speculative fiction stories about 'the world after Amazon.'</p>\n<p>The bonfire is an invitation to participate in a collective reading of stories of such practices we have gathered and to contribute your own first-hand or second-hand stories and thoughts. We intend the reading to be convivial, spilling over into a shared meal.</p>\n<p>Event produced by <a href=\"https://drugo-more.hr/en/figure-it-out/\">Drugo More</a> in collaboration with <a href=\"https://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org\">!Mediengruppe Bitnik</a>.</p>\n<p>Part of transmediale &#x26; CTM <a href=\"https://vorspiel.berlin/events/figure-it-out-ghost-workers\">Vorspiel 2024</a>.</p>"}},"furtherInformationBlocks":[{"id":"cf794fb1-59ec-518e-bc40-bde81bd0963b","title":"Talks by","childContentfulContentBlockBlockContentTextNode":{"id":"bb25f3f3-902e-56ce-98e1-0801da3f8bf1","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><a href=\"http://maxhaiven.com/\">Max Haiven</a> is a writer and teacher and Canada Research Chair in the Radical Imagination.
