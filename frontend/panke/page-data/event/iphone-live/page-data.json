From June 29, 2012 he made his jailbroken iPhone broadcast a screenshot to a public website each time he was pressing the home button – and everybody could watch. He did it as an one-year art performance. This was his manifesto:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I, Johannes P Osterhoff, shall do another one-year performance piece.\nThe piece is called 'iPhone live' and documents the activities performed on my mobile phone during a year.\nThe performance takes place from June 29, 2012 until June 28, 2013.\nI will not use other mobile phones during this year.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Each time a home button on an iPhone is pressed and the current app is minimized, the device automatically takes a screenshot of the this app to display a zooming effect. This is still the case on iPhones today. For his performance, Osterhoff installed two shell scripts on his jailbroken iPhone: the first one duplicated each screenshot so that the files cannot be overwritten the next time the app is minimized. The second script uploaded these screens automatically to his public site.</p>\n<p>Exactly ten years later /rosa will celebrate the anniversary of Osterhoff's performance.\nCelebration will start on June 29, 2022 at 6 PM. All 13567 screenshots will be shown as an evening-long video.\n<a href=\"https://iphone-live.rhizome.org/\">https://iphone-live.rhizome.org/</a></p>"}},"furtherInformationBlocks":[{"id":"d272e5ee-d757-54c2-b4b4-dee8651b034a","title":"participants","childContentfulContentBlockBlockContentTextNode":{"id":"a4d64bc9-5c4c-5011-ad92-9a4425cd00b9","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Four companions will look back on the performance, contextualize it, and reflect from current developments in art, society, and technology:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://disruptionlab.org/\">Tatiana Bazzichelli</a>\nDisruption Network Lab</p>\n<p>Tatiana Bazzichelli is a curator and researcher on information technology, network culture, hacktivism and whistleblowing.
