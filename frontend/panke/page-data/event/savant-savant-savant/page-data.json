The game is derived from a traditional non-verbal intelligence test called the Raven’s Progressive Matrices. This test was the first of its kind to circumvent the need for language in order to measure cognitive capacity; through a visual logic system the test determines the takers general abstract ability and fluid intelligence.\nThe term \"savant\" refers to a person who has exceptional skills or knowledge in a particular domain - it is, incidentally, also the name of the person with highest IQ ever measured ringing in at an astounding 228. Her name: Marilyn vos Savant.</p>\n<p>In the context of this exhibition, the idea of cognitive quantification is used as an aesthetic pointer that informs the production of the works in terms of their technical expression and their formal compositions. Cognitive quantification is, at the same time, a central component of today’s human experience, technological devices and computational logics condition nearly all of our social and environmental relations.</p>\n<p>Accompanying the installation is a set of drawings manipulated on screen. The exhibition presents a mode of speculation and drifting off; distracted notebook drawings are placed in contrast to attention capturing game technology. On a small scale, the show proposes the notions of thought and learning in the light of a common denominator: algorithmically aided production.</p>"}},"furtherInformationBlocks":[{"id":"46881053-a33d-506b-9279-aea53c635b5a","title":"About the Artist","childContentfulContentBlockBlockContentTextNode":{"id":"6bb2ebe3-4c24-5903-866e-b89ba1746c96","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Bertram von Undall’s work engages a variety of media ranging from CGI, graphic design and video recordings to sound, fiction and gaming technologies.\nTheir compositions draw on theoretical research in the nested arenas of the psychic, the social and the technological, with an affinity for practices of learning and feeling.
