This time in frame of Transmediale Vorspiel.</p>\n<p><strong>LOREM — ADVERSARIAL FEELINGS / Presentation</strong>\nIn contemporary data-driven societies we increasingly experience a lack of tools when when trying to represent phenomena. Truth is not something to mirror anymore. Many agencies interact with its own structure, which is liquid and adversarial and more and more operational.When we address our interests toward complex cultural devices, it seems impossible to depict them by simplifying their ecosystems. Representations often turn then into simulations, which mantains the same complexity as the observed contexts: truth becomes something to perform. Modern tools such Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence allow us to reconstruct complex ecosystem, simulating their structure through the lens of a non—human form of intelligence. Especially when they are employed to deal with huge data architectures, neural networks behave in a peculiar, non human, fashion. Trying to inspect their way to face complexity could be useful to understand and to disfruit their own potential.</p>\n<p>But Neural Networks are nowadays widely used to detect, classify and reconstruct emotions, mainly in order to map users behaviours and to affect them in effective ways. What happens when we use Machine Learning to perform human feelings? And what if we use it to produce a simulation of subjectivity and its agencies, rather then to affect consumers? Adversarial Feelings is an attempt to inform non-human intelligence with emotional data sets, in order to build an algorithmic intimacy through those intelligent devices. Thus, neural networks are trained to classify and then to produced a sometimes really arbitrary catalogue of  “states of counciousness” from text, midi and images (according to Plumchick's \"Wheel of Emotions\"). The goal is to observe subjective/affective dimension from the outside, to speak about human emotions as perceived by non-human eyes. Transposing them into a new shape helps Lorem to embrace a new perspective, and to embrace fractured experiences.</p>"}},"furtherInformationBlocks":[{"id":"fdb0ab60-9533-52c4-9a16-49b980860327","title":"artists_SoundNight13","childContentfulContentBlockBlockContentTextNode":{"id":"3df40b58-c848-55ec-9758-91a3277c6bf9","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>LOREM</strong>\nLorem is a music-driven multidisciplinary project by Italian musician and visual artist Francesco D'Abbraccio. Working with neural networks and artificial intelligence systems, he produces sounds, visuals and texts. In the last three years Lorem built a collaborative platform involving AI artists (Mario Klingemann, Yuma Kishi), AI researchers (Damien Henry, Nicola Cattabiani), Videoartists (Karol Sudolski, Mirek Hardiker) and music instruments designers (Luca Pagan, Paolo Ferrari) in the processes.\nAdversarial Feelings is Lorem's first release, consisting in a 22 min AV piece + 9 music tracks and a book. The record was released by Krisis Publishing via Cargo Music UK.</p>\n<p>Adversarial Feelings was screened at Sheffield International Documentary Festival (World Première), on June 10th, 2019. The AV album recently won RE:HUMANISM prize (for intersections between AI and Arts).\nAdversarial Feelings was shown and performed (among others) at Galleria Nazionale di Arte Moderna and Albumarte (Rome, ITA), Gislaveds Konsthall (Gislaveds, SWE), KEYS (Berlin, GER), Saturnalia Festival (Macao,Milan, ITA), Videocittà (Rome, ITA). Videos were broadcasted by NTS Radio, Boiler Room, CLOT, CDM and more.</p>\n<p><strong>FRANCESCO D'ABBRACCIO</strong>\nFrancesco D’Abbraccio is an Italian musician, visual artist and independent researcher. He is active in underground music and art scene since 2008 with electronic experimental duo Aucan (more then 400 live gigs across Europe, Africa and Asia), with the collective Unità di Crisi and recently with his new audiovisual project Lorem. Focusing on politics of representation and transmedial culture, he realised projects for a wide variety of institutions. His work has been exhibited at London Design Biennale, Sheffield International Documentary Festival, Museo Triennale di Milano, Galleria Nazionale di Arte Moderna di Roma, Museo MACRO (Rome), Fondazione Bevilacqua la Masa di Venezia. He is creative director of Krisis Publishing, an independent publishing and curatorial platform focusing on the impact of media culture on contemporary societies.</p>\n<p><strong>Mara Oscar Cassiani</strong>\nMara Oscar Cassiani, wi-fi based artist working in the realms of performance, new digital languages, choreography and ritual clubbing. Her research is focused on creating a contemporary imagery, where new languages, icons and visuals stem from the Internet and subculture identities and “brutal” capitalism. A live stream of images and consciousness in the rhythm of music. Her main research is focused in the creation of performing environments and projects amongst a generational core and their ritualistic development. She mixes and combines images and excerpts from pop, ritual folklore, digital folklore and commerce language to create a global snapshot, a “visual fast food” between kitsch, raw rituality and apocalypse.</p>"}}}],"featuredImage":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/1GHjTsEFQOVouH8X3s9zky/782b1dc6843ba3d9c28b8de19ffdb843/mara?w=750&h=500&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/1GHjTsEFQOVouH8X3s9zky/782b1dc6843ba3d9c28b8de19ffdb843/mara?w=1050&h=700&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/1GHjTsEFQOVouH8X3s9zky/782b1dc6843ba3d9c28b8de19ffdb843/mara?w=1080&h=720&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1080w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/1GHjTsEFQOVouH8X3s9zky/782b1dc6843ba3d9c28b8de19ffdb843/mara?w=1050&h=700&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/1GHjTsEFQOVouH8X3s9zky/782b1dc6843ba3d9c28b8de19ffdb843/mara?w=750&h=500&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/1GHjTsEFQOVouH8X3s9zky/782b1dc6843ba3d9c28b8de19ffdb843/mara?w=1050&h=700&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/1GHjTsEFQOVouH8X3s9zky/782b1dc6843ba3d9c28b8de19ffdb843/mara?w=1080&h=720&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1080w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"transparent","width":1050,"height":700,"placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAlgCWAAD/2wBDAAEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQH/2wBDAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQH/wAARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQAICv/EACMQAAICAgEEAgMAAAAAAAAAAAIDAQQFBgcACBESEyEJFDH/xAAXAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBggJ/8QAIxEAAgMAAQMEAwAAAAAAAAAAAQMCBAUGAAciERITFRYjUf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A5WO3vSu3vYU43E8ma/laOTGvXXOQGsl1GzYIBAnXDK3jmVa6yiGOsMm2qSM1SryEtFCOU/xp6nquo6/v1HB6lRwe4agzZtP/AGc2yxX2ymNVZvyOGu02pWo6g2arZxz0i4PcGX1UmWlV0llR3+MQxFyphxgiKWMWWRsQDB8wyFlClLiQgomf55n2nzM/XhAKHe3fznAPEHG3JPHFLfsRxntG15fSbTtwzuMu4ihmq2JqI1iWMr5aXa7ioxtV9SmBIYLkp+J6EixLdG73YqtXt5mdx29x26I2CLFl2ODbGempJ6pyTfzVVXsYxaktEniXxtZOIE4AmZamjrK0N7Z1k62hUnnxOfk/k+jmo+wddUpvttZtwtq+1LpNT+hqSxMYtIiyQ6LHMaFbxd0qwYxMBIC0B9waQiclAwcwyYEvAwUhE/UTE/UzIxdar5O7mMXsO22skHFeJwwFTx1ccfidmytOgkKtNSF/BWRVUpPssBlkAEe7fdpeTYU9XTKe13alJ+LQ5TVo3l+FymrjF166tmHpFyIOXllbYrYJRiyBMJARMT6dCryfuGyulh43Zn71xkJ/e5/mCAYy8tIS8gInyAP9APqOv//Z"}}},"eventImpressionsSlideshow":null,"eventDocumentationImagesBelow":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"soundnight13"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
