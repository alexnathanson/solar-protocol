She experiments with movement and code, exploring the calculated and the feeling through intimate performances, texts, podcasts, videos, algorithms, and online artworks. The formats of her artworks emerge from the contents themselves; each work is a process that experiments with the how and the why, often bringing together opposing ideas through softness and imaginative and poetic equations of the everyday boundaries of being a body entangled with digital technologies. Movement for her is like thinking which is like coding: they are all processes of understanding the complex world by being in it. She is founder of the project Flee Immediately!, co-founder of the podcast Liminal Bits and a member of the telematic improvisation group The Placeholder Group.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.joanachicau.com\" title=\"Joana Chicau\">Joana Chicau</a> is a graphic designer, coder, researcher — with a background in dance. In her practice she interweaves web programming languages and environments with choreography. She researches the intersection of the body with the constructed, designed, programmed environment, aiming at widening the ways in which digital sciences is presented and made accessible to the public. She has been actively participating and organizing events with performances involving multi-location collaborative coding, algorithmic improvisation, open discussions on gender equality and activism.</p>"}}}],"featuredImage":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4ARwlgl8ehqmpdyLxEFTMc/9521ae0fa6a4102db97128d696eff3b2/FromMeToYou07.png?w=750&h=469&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4ARwlgl8ehqmpdyLxEFTMc/9521ae0fa6a4102db97128d696eff3b2/FromMeToYou07.png?w=1050&h=656&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4ARwlgl8ehqmpdyLxEFTMc/9521ae0fa6a4102db97128d696eff3b2/FromMeToYou07.png?w=1080&h=675&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1080w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4ARwlgl8ehqmpdyLxEFTMc/9521ae0fa6a4102db97128d696eff3b2/FromMeToYou07.png?w=1280&h=800&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4ARwlgl8ehqmpdyLxEFTMc/9521ae0fa6a4102db97128d696eff3b2/FromMeToYou07.png?w=1050&h=656&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4ARwlgl8ehqmpdyLxEFTMc/9521ae0fa6a4102db97128d696eff3b2/FromMeToYou07.png?w=750&h=469&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4ARwlgl8ehqmpdyLxEFTMc/9521ae0fa6a4102db97128d696eff3b2/FromMeToYou07.png?w=1050&h=656&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4ARwlgl8ehqmpdyLxEFTMc/9521ae0fa6a4102db97128d696eff3b2/FromMeToYou07.png?w=1080&h=675&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent 1080w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/4ARwlgl8ehqmpdyLxEFTMc/9521ae0fa6a4102db97128d696eff3b2/FromMeToYou07.png?w=1280&h=800&q=100&fm=png&bg=transparent 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"transparent","width":1050,"height":656,"placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"}}},"exhibitionImpressionsSlideshow":null,"exhibitionDocumentationImagesBelow":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"flows-frommetoyou-myscreentoyours"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
