The participants focus ranges from artistic analysis and applied political research in the field to active union related work on the ground.</p>\n<p>Participants:\n<strong>Joanna Bronowicka</strong>, <strong>Sebastian Schmieg</strong>, <strong>Akseli Aittomäki</strong> moderated by Aram Bartholl</p>\n<p><strong>Sebastian Schmieg</strong> is an artist who’s work engages with the algorithmic circulation of images, texts and bodies within contexts that blur the boundaries between human and software, individual and crowd, or labor and leisure. At the centre of his practice are playful interventions into found systems that explore hidden – and often absurd – aspects behind the glossy interfaces of our networked society. Schmieg works in a wide range of media such as video, website, installation, artist book, custom software and lecture performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Joanna Bronowicka</strong> is a sociologist and community organiser living in Berlin. She is researching the impact of technology on society at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder). Until recently, she was the director of the Centre for Internet and Human Rights. Joanna has been fighting for rights of women, workers and migrants for over a decade. She is a member of Polish left-wing party Razem which has an active branch in Berlin.</p>\n<p><strong>Akseli Aittomäki</strong> is a dance artist and experimental theater-maker. His works involve different productions, research and activism. His art practice ranges from experimental theater to contemporary dance and philosophically motivated performance works. Critics characterize his choreography productions as 'essayistic'. Economic questions and political protest play an important role in his research. Aittomäki was a rider for Deliveroo for over two years. He was engaged in campaigns to improve the working conditions of the riders, such as protests, strikes, collaboration with media or providing help for workers after work accidents. Deliveroo pulling out of Germany is the moment for him to share his perspective.</p>"}}}],"featuredImage":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[{"srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=750&h=500&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=1050&h=700&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=1080&h=720&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1080w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=1366&h=911&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1366w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=1920&h=1280&q=100&fm=webp&bg=transparent 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw","type":"image/webp"}],"fallback":{"src":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=1050&h=700&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent","srcSet":"https://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=750&h=500&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 750w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=1050&h=700&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1050w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=1080&h=720&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1080w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=1366&h=911&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1366w,\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/31ro1qkhyo69/7jRLL92IPkKrpvLh4kES8X/33e98bc693b72d7d4d1f55bcdee7d234/strike-now-aram-bartholl-WEBversion.jpg?w=1920&h=1280&fl=progressive&q=100&fm=jpg&bg=transparent 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1050px) 1050px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"transparent","width":1050,"height":700,"placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"}}},"exhibitionImpressionsSlideshow":null,"exhibitionDocumentationImagesBelow":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"strike-now"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
