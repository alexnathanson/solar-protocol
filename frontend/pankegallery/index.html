          What does growth mean nowadays? In an era of planetary emergency,
          voices for scaling down and changing pace multiply. Terms like
          ‘degrowth’ –, post development and ‘buen vivir’ (well living) are used
          more and more to highlight the need to acknowledge planetary
          interdependencies and set boundaries to the use of earth’s limited
          resources. At the same time, people and states around the world do not
          hold the same responsibility with regard to the issue. How can we
          articulate responses together and establish dialogues across
          geographies, discourses and practices that are committed to living
          otherwise? <br />
          <br />
          Esc return ↩ addresses these topics through a gathering of diverse
          practitioners from the fields of art, design and architecture.
          Discussions will unfold around:

          <li>
            ❀ the possibilities of traditional knowledges and low tech; the urge

          <li>𖤣 the empowerment of commons – and community based economies;</li>

          re·execution: A constant, yet still dynamic UnReLearning process.<br /><br />

          When imagining a more sustainable future, the role of technology in it
          comes to the foreground. Green tech solutions have their limitations
          and contradictions given the fact that their manufacturing depends on
          earth resources exploitation, and their eventual disposal is
          unavoidable. Living sustainably signifies a radical re-imagining of
          how to live, how to consume and how to be attentive to the impact
          anthropogenic activity has on the environment. This discussion brings
          together practitioners from the field of art and design working on and
          with relevant infrastructures, tools and ideas. Low tech solutions,
          traditional knowledges, radical prototypes, and forms of social
          relationship will be discussed as starting points for building,
          understanding and/or using technologies of different scope and scale.

          Food production, distribution, and culture are crucial aspects that
          need to be reimagined in order to make degrowth come true. How can we
          cultivate new ways of sharing food? What rituals and habits could be
          helpful to enjoy more considerate consumption? How should we change
          our relationship with 'More-Than-Human' agents within the agricultural
          context? How can we shift our food habits from individualistic
          cravings to collective caring? And what ingredients could help us to
          taste the idea of degrowth? <br /><br />
          Gosia Lehmann is going to set-up culinary experiments and develop
          flavourful interventions as conversation starters for the debate on
          how to eat to reconceptualize our flawed food system.

          Repeated as a mantra of the new world, “DATA is the new oil” has been
          the dominant logic driving our relationships in our natural and
          artificial environments. This has led to the orchestration and
          fabrication of physical and digital extractivist systems. If we are to
          overcome the othering provoked by binary thinking, what other
          vocabularies, lexicons and grammar can we learn from languages attuned
          with the rhythms of the planet? What logic is to be found embedded in
          the very constructs of nature, territory, environment, landscape,
          field or Umwelt? What possibilities are offered to situate ourselves
          in ecologies of interdependence and not merely of opposition? The
          practitioners of this group will offer diverse angles for situated
          grounding through land and climatic practices, approached as learning
          spaces. If we have been aspiring to the cloud of globalism, what can
          we spark when we connect through our roots? How can we break digital
          and physical monoculture and expand permacultural relational
          practices? How does the notion of response-ability change?

          If growth at all costs is to be challenged, other assemblies and
          understandings of governance and economies are needed, such that would
          relate to the specificities of place and take in mind societal and
          environmental impacts. With the imposition of a single global system,
          the logic underneath the import / export of goods turned pervasive.
          This dis·location has rendered contexts meaningless, supporting the
          illusion that things will work in the same way no matter where they
          take place. How can we de·link from the dominant matrix of power? How
          can we re·assemble relations in the form of other governance models,
          exchange systems and relational economies? What does an economy
          following degrowth or embracing buen vivir look like? And how
          sustainable or resilient are the communities that support it? The
          practitioners of this cluster will offer stories, reflections and
          visions around situated distributed systems, commons-based
          initiatives, social coins and systemic relational design.

          The call for a continuous acceleration and optimisation that supports
          the imaginary of economic progress has led to an exhaustion of both
          bodies and resources, hitting some territories more than others. Which
          practices can assist in healing wounds caused by a legacy of
          exploitation? How possible is it to restore broken societal systems
          and human to nature bonds, in order to face the asymmetries and forms
          of injustice of the western patriarchal world? The speakers of this
          panel will discuss feminist practices pointing towards infrastructures
          of interdependence and co-existence, care and maintenance. With
          examples from the fields of architecture, design and art, emphasis

          OPENING 19:00-22:00
          05/09/2024–19/10/2024<br /><br />

          The group exhibition titled “Alt Nets,” at panke.gallery brings
          together artistic positions that explore the intersection of community
          networks, low tech and permacomputing. The relation between these
          concepts lies in their shared values of community empowerment,
          sustainability, and accessibility. They represent different aspects of
          grassroots efforts to reclaim control over technology and
          communication infrastructure, while also promoting environmental
          stewardship and social justice/equality.<br />
          Central to the exhibition is the recognition of the qualities derived
          from grounding artistic practices in existing contexts, conditions,
          and communities. Unlike the solutions proposed by technocratic elites,
          which often overlook collective efforts and community organization,
          the artists featured in "Alt Nets" prioritize nurturing and
          strengthening the communities they grew from.<br /><br />

          14:00–19:00 <br /><br />
          The workshop led by Ola Bonati and Brendan Howell aims to provide
          participants with a playful exploration of the concepts and philosophy
          of permacompiting. In one day, we will experiment with alternative
          ways of communication using repurposed electronics and based on
          speculative futures. We will create role-playing scenarios in which
          constant (and instant) access to the network is not a given. Can we
          force ourselves to think of resource-minimalist futures while living
          in a maximalist reality? How can we regain some of the agency by
          stepping out of the mainstream use of media? How can we apply
          permacomputing principles in our daily practice? We invite you to join
          us in pursuit of answers to these questions!<br /><br />

          ><br /><br />
          15:00–19:00 <br /><br />
          Liaizon Wakest will guide a tour of the autonomous social space known
          as the fediverse. Explore the challenges and potentials of this
          unraveling hydra where individual autonomy and collective action
          intersect. Each node in the network can range from a single autonomous
          human operator to millions under the control of a multinational
          corporation, all utilizing the same methods of exchange. This diverse
          spectrum of ownership and governance within the fediverse reflects the
          complexity of digital ecosystems, where individuals and corporations
          coexist and interact within a shared strata. The evening will start
          with an introduction and brief history of the fediverse. Everyone will
          set up an account and then collectively navigate across various
          islands of the network and ponder questions together as they arise.<br /><br />

          The "Waldgartenpilot Rehfelde" is a community project that aims to transform an area 
          of 2.7 hectare in the vicinity of Berlin into a place of food production that is both 
          ecologically and economically successful, and to make these steps comprehensible and 
          replicable for future initiatives as a pilot project. The idea for a forest garden at 
          this location goes back to the initiator Ramos. Matthias has been part of the core team 
          since spring 2020 and cofounded the project in Rehfelde-Dorf.

          10/10/2024–11/10/2024
          <br /><br />
          Telepresencia takes place as a planetary intervention between Europe
          and South America, urban and rural environments, the metropolis of
          Berlin and the hinterland of San Marcos Sierras in Argentina.
          Addressing the climate catastrophe and resistance and versus war
          participants from both sides will collaborate in a week-long
          telepresence. Analog and electronic instruments and devices such as
          habitat, action, off grid communications, composing, effect, live
          moving images and -video are used in joint improvisations such as
          sessions, a concert and a club event. Guest spirits speak en vivo into
          the stream. The live circuit transports the argentine wasteland
          audivisually into the Panke Gallery. Cross-linking simultaneous views
          of the hybridization of both places, the results of the telepresencia,
          real and utopian, historical and scientific, on a conceptual
          accelerofuturistic background, serve as a trigger for artistic
          degrowth.<br /><br />

        <p></p>
        <p class="bigtext">
          The project "find.select.transform – Resilient Networks in a Wounded
          World" responds to the pressing social, ecological, and economic
          challenges of our time. It employs artistic positions to critically
          examine how current technological developments and organizational
          practices can contribute to a sustainable transformation of our
          society.<br /><br />

          The project aims to highlight alternative strategies, aesthetic
          positions, and networks that challenge the conventional understanding
          of growth. In doing so, it emphasizes the role of art in narrating
          such developments and seeks ways to address power imbalances and
          extractivism.<br /><br />

          The focus will be on artistic positions regarding the climate
          catastrophe and community networks that promote democratic
          participation and equality.<br /><br />

          The schedule for 2024 includes the symposium in May, the presentation
          of telepresent artists and a live streaming event in June, lectures in
          June and September, as well as the exhibition and accompanying
          programs from September to October. The variety of formats promotes
          interdisciplinarity and multiperspectivity.<br />
