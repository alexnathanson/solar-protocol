            <p>On 23rd May 2019, the first train of Starlink satellites sailed into the atmosphere in 
                a line too ordered to be natural and too fast to belong amongst the stars. These dotted 
                lines of reflected sunlight point the way to a network, thousands strong, of communication 
                satellites currently encircling the globe in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO). Our project uses the natural 
                intelligence of the Solar Protocol network to reflect back the inherent unsustainability of this 
                idealised new era of satellite connectivity.</p>
            <p>The table on this page lists the passage of SpaceX satellites above the active Solar Protocol server 
                and displays the remaining lifespan of each satellite from the day it was launched. We use a server 
                powered by the logic of the Sun to illuminate the invisible decay of Starlink satellites, rather than 
                their shiny beginnings.</p>

            <p>Rather than being treated as a global commons, LEO is an extension of the airwaves dominated by tech giants. 
                These ‘megaconstellations’, developed by companies including SpaceX, Amazon, OneWeb and Telesat (with 
                many more to come) endeavour to bridge the digital divide by providing fast-speed internet to remote locations
                , but in doing so they create an exponentially crowded orbital space and contaminated astronomical data that 
                limits pathways to interplanetary exploration. </p>

            <p>In an effort to prevent the satellites ending up as space junk, the anticipated life expectancy of an individual 
            Starlink module is about <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/01/spacex-launch-first-starlink-mission-2021/">5 years</a>
             before it, at best, de-orbits and burns up entirely upon re-entry. Rather than 
            being built for longevity, this planned obsolescence thrives on constant upgrade and resupply in a model of 
            consumption disproportionate to the immense cultural, political, and environmental impacts of an infrastructure 
            that literally expands beyond our world.</p>

            <p>Adding to this is the increasing risk of rocket debris falling back to Earth in unpredictable locations – even as SpaceX is 
                celebrated for implementing the first reusable launch system, one that relies on indefinite emissions of carbon-based fuel in 
                the face of our current climate disaster.</p>

            <p>While leaving blatant traces of light across the sky while in orbit, what physical traces will these satellites leave in their 
                wake? The burn up of material will deposit fine aluminium particles into the atmosphere at a scale far beyond natural quantities 
                which could activate a process akin to geoengineering the Earth’s climate. What are the consequences of this when these 
                infrastructures are striving for infinite growth?</p>

            <p>The omnipresence of digital connection should not come at the expense of our sky, and risks blinding us from the vital 
                natural connections between Earth, atmosphere and Sun that we need to survive.</p>
