        <h3>RECONFIGURING THE CLOUD</h3>
 
                    <p>September 2017: A couple of friends and I are yelling blunt slogans like “Save the Internet” and
                        “Our Data, Our Rules” as part of a small demonstration we organized in front of “Darwin’s
                        Circle”, a periodical conference assembling various major tech companies in Vienna, Austria. The
                        demonstration was one portion of a larger campaign and an animation series—a contemporary
                        fairytale about e-privacy and data sovereignty—we developed for the Vienna Biennale. We were
                        advocating for political engagement and a decentralized, democratic internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>But to better grasp what a decentralized internet, and the configurations emerging from it,
                        could look like, we first had to study and dissect the pieces that would make up its
                        infrastructure.
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It soon became apparent that though the so-called “cloud” does <a
                            href="https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/cloud-thinking-d92c5cd4b439#.n7yfuba88">severely
                            influence our atmosphere</a>, the transatlantic internet cables, data centers, and other
                        physical structures that comprise the cloud share little else with its atmospherical eponym.
                        While the internet is composed of very tangible, physical materials, its centralized remote
                        structures more than often evade public gaze and discourse. What would it look like to store
                        and live with our private information in our homes rather than in a server farm? And how
                        could design respond to changing conceptions of privacy? Guided by various conversations
                        with experts from the Viennese hacker and privacy scene, we explored these questions and
                        more. We re-imagined traditional furniture into new pieces like “the dining server”, debated
                        how to use the processors’ access heat at home, and speculated on what happens with an
                        ex-partner’s backup files and server after a relationship ends. The designer and our dear
                        friend <a href="https://johannapichlbauer.com/Our-New-Dining-Server">Johanna Pichlbauer</a> then
                        illustrated some of these musings. </p>

                    <p>In 2018, as an artist and filmmaker with terabytes of raw video files, I opted to get my own
                        server, putting in action what my friends and I had abstractly discussed earlier. I frequently
                        found myself listening to the drives as they started and stopped spinning, touching the server
                        rack, checking on how much heat it generated, how much energy it consumed, when it was active
                        and when it went to sleep—a peculiar attempt at getting to know this new device in my living
                        room. While I knew about servers’ relatively high energy consumption, it turned out to be rather
                        difficult to obtain an informed, more holistic understanding of the internet’s ecological
                        footprint. Since many studies do only focus on particular infrastructural segments and might for
                        instance not factor in the embodied energy necessary to manufacture certain hardware, <a
                            href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-consumption/">estimates
                            on the internet’s energy consumption oftentimes vary greatly</a>. With an exponentially
                        growing
                        demand for cloud computation, it is nevertheless clear that “business as usual” will sooner
                        rather than later exceed our planet’s boundaries.

                    </p>

                    <p>When two of my colleagues and I were building a low-tech wooden windmill to test the University
                        of Applied Arts’ new CNC mill later in 2018, I proposed we power the <a
                            href="https://designinvestigations.at">department’s</a> server and
                        website with it. Unfortunately, I soon realized that, especially in urban environments, wind
                        consistency and direction would change too frequently, and even with a constant, average flux of
                        wind, the setup would not generate enough power.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2019, I revisited the idea of renewably powering a server and set up my self-hosted personal
                        website, <a href="https://www.felixlenz.at">www.felixlenz.at</a>, but this time I designed the
                        site to run on solar energy. In
                        collaboration with my dear friend and web developer <a
                            href="https://github.com/agschnitzer">Alex Gschnitzer</a> and informed by similar
                        setups, such as <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com">Low-tech Magazine's</a> website, we
                        salvaged and ordered the necessary components
                        and started tinkering and coding. On a sunny day, the energy generated by a 150W solar panel can
                        power a charge controller, a 12Ah battery, and a <a
                            href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/A20/A20-OLinuXino-LIME2/open-source-hardware">single-board
                            computer</a>. The latter—our small
                        server—would eventually be connected to a router accessing the internet.
                    </p>

                        © Felix Lenz, 2019
                    </p>

                    <p>When I started assembling the system’s components, I welded a custom solar-panel scaffolding that
                        fit precisely on the 48mm wide handrail of my girlfriend Julia’s balcony in Vienna. I did not
                        consider a more flexible, modular build because back then I could not see how this would
                        potentially be a short-sighted design decision.
                    </p>
                    <p>During its first winter, the website went offline most nights. I could not convince Julia to
                        drill a hole through her wall just to thread a power cable from the outside into her living
                        room, so the cold nights and foggy days (average Viennese winter weather) quickly depleted the
                        battery. I found myself wrapping the battery and server rack in linen—just like one of the
                        balcony plants. Eventually I added foam boards for additional insulation, and to my delight I
                        found the battery was able to sustain its capacity, even on cold nights.

                    <p>During longer periods of bad weather, the battery can keep the server up for about four days.
                        Knowing the inability of the sun's power to keep up with our exponentially increasing bit-rates
                        and file sizes, we decided to embrace rather than hide the setup's limitations. The interface
                        openly shows visitors the server’s power draw, temperature, and uptime, as well as the battery’s
                        charge level and the weather forecast, making it more transparent when the website is about to
                        go offline. The page was developed to be as lightweight as possible; It uses a static site
                        generator and a system typeface to avoid unnecessary HTTP requests, has high image and video
                        compression, and includes no tracking or analytics (which besides being more energy efficient
                        also has the handy side-effect of respecting the visitors’ privacy).

                    <p>While early software developers had to make a virtue of scarce resources by endlessly optimizing
                        their code, programmers today only have to wait one and a half years for machines twice as
                        powerful to become available. This idea is called “Moore’s Law” and was first proposed by Gordon
                        Moore, co-founder of Intel, in 1965. Moore’s Law projected that the speed of processors would
                        double every 18 months.
                    </p>

                    <p>In turn, “Gates’ Law” postulates that the speed of software halves every 18 months, thereby
                        undercutting the progress in processing speeds. While it would be absolutely feasible to
                        implement less energy-intensive code from a technical perspective, the costs of longer
                        development times more than often fall behind the economic benefits of simply waiting for more
                        capable end-devices. However, we should be reminded that improvements in efficiency, either by
                        technology or policy alone, might not be the solution either. In fact, environmental economists
                        would argue that efficiency improvements can trigger lower prices and thereby increase overall
                        use and demand and—as outlined in the <a
                            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/science/08tier.html">Jevons Paradox</a>—even
                        increase resource use.
                    </p>

                    <p>What we need instead, I would argue, are new metaphors and stories around existing technologies,
                        propelling public sensibility, understanding, and discussion—“a metalanguage for describing the
                        world that complex systems have wrought” as the writer, artist, and technologist James Bridle
                        put it in his book <i>New Dark Age</i>. For me, the peculiar technological and personal configurations
                        that emerge from co-living with infrastructural elements like a solar-powered server might be
                        one of many such endeavors. As such, my version of a self-hosted, solar-powered website is by no
                        means a solution to a global problem but rather a way to engender new interactions and
                        narratives that help us renegotiate the status quo.

                    <p>In the years that followed my first server experiment, configurations shifted once again. Julia
                        and I eventually broke up and while my next flat will need to feature a balcony, I am very
                        grateful she is still kindly hosting my website in the meantime. My subsequent artistic ventures
                        have been situated at the intersection of cloud computation, geopolitics, and metrology, and my
                        curiosity gradually shifted from resources like energy to one of our most fundamental building
                        blocks: water.
                    </p>

                    <p>A week from now I will be visiting the EODC or “Earth Observation Data Centre for Water Resources
                        Monitoring” in Vienna. The data center processes petabytes of satellite images from the Sentinel
                        satellites of the European Space Agency, analyzing them, among other meteorological and
                        hydrological indices, in regard to water resource management and drought occurrence. Like most
                        modern data centers, their servers are water-cooled, consuming not just massive amounts of
                        electricity but also water. While climate change is making severe droughts more frequent even in
                        Austria, the situation is worse in other regions of the world. In Mesa, Arizona, a particularly
                        dry region of the United States, Apple built a hyperscale data center consuming up to 4.7
                        million liters of water a day. <a
                            href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/drought-stricken-communities-push-back-against-data-centers-n1271344">Drought-stricken
                            communities are pushing back</a> as the area
                        recently experienced its driest months in 126 years. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case
                        as many data center operators are drawn to water-starved regions in the West of the United
                        States, in part due to the availability of solar and wind energy. While Apple invested in a 50
                        MW solar farm to offset the power used in its data center in Mesa, the company fails to
                        sustainably manage the area’s water resources, especially since water is considerably cheaper
                        than electricity. The case once again illustrates that technological “fixes” alone will continue
                        to fail to address the structural societal and political intricacies at the heart of the
                        problem.

                    <p>As heat waves become more frequent and demand for water increases, many lakes around the
                        world—lake Urmia in Iran, or the Great Salt Lake in Utah (only miles away from the National
                        Security Agency's main data center, which doesn’t just extract human resources but also
                        increasingly depletes water resources)—are currently drying up and even <a
                            href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/01/06/great-salt-lake-utah-drying-up/">set
                            to vanish in the
                            next years</a>. Left behind are exposed lakebeds and vast salt deserts. In the case of lake
                        Urmia
                        and more rigorously documented in the case of the Great Salt Lake, the <a
                            href="https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2022/6/29/23188005/opinion-the-toxic-tale-of-the-great-salt-lake-drought-water-receding-toxic-metals-arsenic-dust-strom">mineral
                            sediments and
                            residues</a> contain high concentrations of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium, copper, mercury,
                        selenium,
                        antimony, lithium, manganese, vanadium, zirconium, and lanthanum. Previously diluted with water,
                        the toxic metals become dry and airborne, spread with the wind and bioaccumulate in the
                        environment. Approximately half of the metals originate from industrial and agricultural
                        activities around the lake (it is hard to overlook Kennecott Copper Mine, the largest man-made
                        excavation and deepest open-pit mine in the world, just miles south of the Great Salt Lake). The
                        elements, some of them carcinogenic, pose a serious health threat to human and non-human
                        entities alike.
                    </p>

                    <p>While our infrastructures and statistical models fail to compute these rapid topological and
                        environmental changes (our historical records, in particular, are no longer suitable points of
                        reference), the landscape itself keeps a database of its own transformation. Mineral deposits
                        have served as geological archives (e.g., of rainfall) dating back several thousands of years
                        and now increasingly record anthropogenic residues as well. The Great Salt Lake’s drying lakebed
                        thus inscribes material evidence of its own drainage by re-sedimenting and re-structuring the
                        fundamental building blocks of our corroding, digital archives.
                    </p>

                    <p>This leaves me with a question that also sits at the heart of the film I am currently working on:
                        Does structured data necessarily need to be considered a human artifact or, as the architect and
                        designer Marco Ferrari put it, could information also be the “cumulative layering of traces
                        already existing in the environment”? By paying close attention, can we re-conceptualize what
                        the archives of and about this world might look like?
                    </p>
