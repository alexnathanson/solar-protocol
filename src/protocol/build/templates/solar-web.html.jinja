    <h4>Solar Web Directory</h4>
    <p>We have taken much inspiration from other solar powered server projects such as the work of <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low Tech
    Magazine</a>. We hope to see many more servers hosted by renewables in the future, whether via hosting at wind or sun powered data centers or by people
    self hosting their sites. This is an in progress directory of such websites.</p>
    <p>Enjoy the sun. Surf the solar powered web.</p>
